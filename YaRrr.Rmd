# Preface {#intro}

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/YaRrr_Cover.jpg')
```

The purpose of this book is to help you learn R from the ground-up. 

## Where did this book come from?

Let me make something very, very clear...

*I did not write this book*. 

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate's Guide to R.

This book clearly has both massive historical and pedagogical significance. Most importantly, it turns out that pirates were programming in R well before the earliest known advent of computers. Of slightly less significance is that the book has turned out to be a surprisingly up-to-date and approachable introductory text to R. For both of these reasons, I felt it was my duty to share the book with the world.

If you or spot any typos or errors, or have any recommendations for future versions of the book, please write me at YaRrr.Book\@gmail.com or tweet me \@YaRrrBook.

## Who is this book for?

While this book was originally written for pirates, I think that anyone who wants to learn R can benefit from this book. If you haven't had an introductory course in statistics, some of the later statistical concepts may be difficult, but I'll try my best to add brief descriptions of new topics when necessary. Likewise, if R is your first programming language, you'll likely find the first few chapters quite challenging as you learn the basics of programming. However, if R is your first programming language, that's totally fine as what you learn here will help you in learning other languages as well (if you choose to). Finally, while the techniques in this book apply to most data analysis problems, because my background is in experimental psychology I will cater the course to solving analysis problems commonly faced in psychological research.

**What this book is**

This book is meant to introduce you to the basic analytical tools in R, from basic coding and analyses, to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical inference.

**What this book is not**

This book does not cover any one topic in extensive detail. If you are interested in conducting analyses or creating plots not covered in the book, I'm sure you'll find the answer with a quick Google search!

## Why is R so great?

As you've already gotten this book, you probably already have some idea why R is so great. However, in order to help prevent you from giving up the first time you run into a programming wall, let me give you a few more reasons:

1. R is 100\% free and as a result, has a huge support community. Unlike SPSS, Matlab, Excel and JMP, R is, and always will be completely free. This doesn't just help your wallet - it means that a huge community of R programmers will constantly develop an distribute new R functionality and packages at a speed that leaves all those other packages in the dust! Unlike Fight Club, the first rule of R is "Do talk about R!" The size of the R programming community is staggering. If you ever have a question about how to implement something in R, a quick Poogle\footnote{I am in the process of creating Poogle - Google for Pirates. Kickstarter page coming soon...} search will lead you to your answer virtually every single time.

2. R is the presnt, and future of statistical programming. To illustrate this, look at the following three figures. These are Google trend searches for three terms: R Programming, Matlab, and SPSS. Try and guess which one is which.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/googletrends.png")
```

3. R is incredibly versatile. You can use R to do everything from calculating simple summary statistics, to performing complex simulations to creating gorgeous plots like the chord diagram on the right. If you can imagine an analytical task, you can almost certainly implement it in R.

4. Using RStudio, a program to help you write R code, You can easily and seamlessly combine R code, analyses, plots, and written text into elegant documents all in one place using Sweave (R and Latex) or RMarkdown. In fact, I translated this entire book (the text, formatting, plots, code...yes, everything) in RStudio using Sweave. With RStudio and Sweave, instead of trying to manage two or three programs, say Excel, Word and (sigh) SPSS, where you find yourself spending half your time copying, pasting and formatting data, images and test, you can do everything in one place so nothing gets misread, mistyped, or forgotten.

```{r, fig.cap = "A super cool chord diagram from the circlize package"}
circlize::chordDiagram(matrix(sample(10), 
                              nrow = 2, ncol = 5))
```


5. Analyses conducted in R are transparent, easily shareable, and reproducible. If you ask an SPSS user how they conducted a specific analyses, they will either A) Not remember,  B) Try (nervously) to construct an analysis procedure on the spot that makes sense - which may or may not correspond to what they actually did months or years ago, or C) Ask you what you are doing in their house. I used to primarily use SPSS, so I speak from experience on this. If you ask an R user (who uses good programming techniques!) how they conducted an analysis, they should always be able to show you the exact code they used. Of course, this doesn't mean that they used the appropriate analysis or interpreted it correctly, but with all the original code, any problems should be completely transparent!

6. And most importantly of all, R is the programming language of choice for pirates.



## R is like a relationship...

Yes, R is very much like a relationship. Like relationships, there are two major truths to R programming:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Yep, R will become both your best friend and your worst nightmare. The bad times will make the good times oh so much sweeter.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rrelationship.png")
```

1. There is nothing more *frustrating* than when your code does *not* work

2. There is nothing more *satisfying* than when your code *does* work!


Anything worth doing, from losing weight to getting a degree, takes time. Learning R is no different. Especially if this is your first experience programming, you are going to experience a *lot* of headaches when you get started. You will run into error after error and pound your fists against the table screaming: "WHY ISN'T MY CODE WORKING?!?!? There must be something wrong with this stupid software!!!" You will spend hours trying to find a bug in your code, only to find that - frustratingly enough, you had had an extra space or missed a comma somewhere. You'll then wonder why you ever decided to learn R when (::sigh::) SPSS was so "nice and easy."


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "When you first meet R, it will look so fugly that you'll wonder if this is all some kind of sick joke. But trust me, once you learn how to talk to it, and clean it up a bit, all your friends will be crazy jealous.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gosling.png")
```

**Fun Fact!** SPSS stands for "Shitty Piece of Shitty Shit". True story.

This is perfectly normal! Don't get discouraged and DON'T GO BACK TO SPSS! That would be quitting on exercise altogether because you had a tough workout.

Trust me, as you gain more programming experience, you'll experience fewer and fewer bugs (though they'll never go away completely). Once you get over the initial barriers, you'll find yourself conducting analyses much, much faster than you ever did before.


## Who am I?

```{r, fig.cap= "Like a pirate, I work best with a mug of beer within arms' reach.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beer.jpg")
```

My name is Nathaniel -- not Nathan...not Nate...and *definitely* not Nat. I am a psychologist with a background in statistics and judgment and decision making. You can find my R (and non-R) related musings at [http://ndphillips.github.io](http://ndphillips.github.io)

# Getting Started {#started}

## Installing (Base) R and RStudio

First things first, let's download both Base R and Rstudio. Again, R is the basic software which contains the R programming language. RStudio is software that makes R programming easier. Of course, they are totally free and open source.


```{r, fig.cap= "", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/rlogo.png"))
```

| Operating System| Link|
|:------|:----|
|     Windows|    [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)|
|     Mac|    [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)|


Once you've installed base R on your computer, try opening it. When you do you should see a screen like the one in Figure \@ref(fig:rscreenshot) (this is the Mac version). As you can see, base R is very much bare-bones software. It's kind of the equivalent of a simple text editor that comes with your computer.


```{r, fig.cap= "{Here is how the base R application looks. While you can use the base R application alone, most people I know use RStudio -- software that helps you to write and use R code more efficiently!", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align ="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/RScreenshot.png"))
```

While you can do pretty much everything you want within base R, you'll find that most people these days do their R programming in an application called RStudio. RStudio is a graphical user interface (GUI)-like interface for R that makes programming in R a bit easier. In fact, once you've installed RStudio, you'll likely never need to open the base R application again. To download and install RStudio (around 40mb), go to one of the links above and follow the instructions.

```{r, fig.cap= "", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/RStudio.png"))
```


| Operating System| Link|
|:------|:----|
|     All|    [http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)|

Let's go ahead and boot up RStudio and see how she looks!

## The four RStudio Windows

When you open RStudio, you'll see the following four windows (also called panes) shown in in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudiowindows). However, your windows might be in a different order that those in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudiowindows). If you'd like, you can change the order of the windows under RStudio preferences. You can also change their shape by either clicking the minimize or maximize buttons on the top right of each panel, or by clicking and dragging the middle of the borders of the windows.


```{r rstudiowindows, fig.cap= "The four panes of RStudio.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png"))
```

Now, let's see what each window does in detail.

### Source - Your notepad for code

```{r sourcewindow, fig.cap= "The Source contains all of your individual R scripts.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/piratesanalysisss.png"))
```

The source pane is where you create and edit ``R Scripts" - your collections of code. Don't worry, R scripts are just text files with the ".R" extension. When you open RStudio, it will automatically start a new Untitled script. Before you start typing in an untitled R script, you should always save the file under a new file name (like, "2015PirateSurvey.R"). That way, if something on your computer crashes while you're working, R will have your code waiting for you when you re-open RStudio.

You'll notice that when you're typing code in a script in the Source panel, R won't actually evaluate the code as you type. To have R actually evaluate your code, you need to first 'send' the code to the Console (we'll talk about this in the next section).

There are many ways to send your code from the Source to the console. The slowest way is to copy and paste. A faster way is to highlight the code you wish to evaluate and clicking on the "Run" button on the top right of the Source. Alternatively, you can use the hot-key "Command + Return" on Mac, or "Control + Enter" on PC to send all highlighted code to the console.


### Console: R's Heart

```{r consolewindow, fig.cap= "The console the calculation heart of R. All of your code will (eventually) go through here.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/consoless.png"))
```


The console is the heart of R. Here is where R actually evaluates code. At the beginning of the console you'll see the character \texttt{>}. This is a prompt that tells you that R is ready for new code. You can type code directly into the console after the \texttt{>} prompt and get an immediate response. For example, if you type 1+1 into the console and press enter, you'll see that R immediately gives an output of 2.

```{r}
1+1
```


Try calculating 1+1 by typing the code directly into the console - then press Enter. You should see the result [1] 2. Don't worry about the [1] for now, we'll get to that later. For now, we're happy if we just see the 2. Then, type the same code into the Source, and then send the code to the Console by highlighting the code and clicking the ``Run" button on the top right hand corner of the Source window. Alternatively, you can use the hot-key "Command + Return" on Mac or "Control + Enter" on Windows.

**Tip**: Try to write most of your code in a document in the Source. Only type directly into the Console to de-bug or do quick analyses.}

So as you can see, you can execute code either by running it from the Source or by typing it directly into the Console. However, 99\% most of the time, you should be using the Source rather than the Console. The reason for this is straightforward: If you type code into the console, it won't be saved (though you can look back on your command History). And if you make a mistake in typing code into the console, you'd have to re-type everything all over again. Instead, it's better to write all your code in the Source. When you are ready to execute some code, you can then send "Run" it to the console.


### Environment / History


```{r environment, fig.cap= "The environment panel shows you all the objects you have defined in your current workspace. You'll learn more about workspaces in Chapter 7.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/environmentss.png"))
```

The Environment tab of this panel shows you the names of all the data objects (like vectors, matrices, and dataframes) that you've defined in your current R session. You can also see information like the number of observations and rows in data objects. The tab also has a few clickable actions like ``Import Dataset" which will open a graphical user interface (GUI) for important data into R. However, I almost never look at this menu.

The History tab of this panel simply shows you a history of all the code you've previously evaluated in the Console. To be honest, I never look at this. In fact, I didn't realize it was even there until I started writing this tutorial.

As you get more comfortable with R, you might find the Environment / History panel useful. But for now you can just ignore it. If you want to declutter your screen, you can even just minimize the window by clicking the minimize button on the top right of the panel.


### Files / Plots / Packages / Help

The Files / Plots / Packages / Help panel shows you lots of helpful information. Let's go through each tab in detail:

1. Files - The files panel gives you access to the file directory on your harddrive. One nice feature of the "Files" panel is that you can use it to set your working directory - once you navigate to a folder you want to read and save files to, click "More" and then "Set As Working Directory." We'll talk about working directories in more detail soon.

2. Plots - The Plots panel (no big surprise), shows all your plots. There are buttons for opening the plot in a separate window and exporting the plot as a pdf or jpeg (though you can also do this with code using the `pdf()` or `jpeg()` functions.)

Let's see how plots are displayed in the Plots panel. Run the code on the right to display a histogram of the weights of chickens stored in the `ChickWeight` dataset. When you do, you should see a plot similar to the one in Figure \@ref(fig:plotpanel) show up in the Plots panel.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hist(x = ChickWeight$weight,
     main = "Chicken Weights",
     xlab = "Weight",
     col = "skyblue",
     border = "white")
```


```{r plotpanel, fig.cap= "The plot panel contains all of your plots, like this histogram of the distribution of chicken weights.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plotpanelss.png"))
```



3. Packages - Shows a list of all the R packages installed on your harddrive and indicates whether or not they are currently loaded. Packages that are loaded in the current session are checked while those that are installed but not yet loaded are unchecked. We'll discuss packages in more detail in the next section.

4. Help - Help menu for R functions. You can either type the name of a function in the search window, or use the code \texttt{?function.name} to search for a function with the name \texttt{function.name}


```{r, eval = FALSE}
?hist   # How does the histogram function work?
?t.test # What about a t-test?
```


## Packages

When you download and install R for the first time, you are installing the Base R software. Base R will will contain most of the functions you'll use on a daily basis like `mean()` and `hist()`. However, only functions written by the original authors of the R language will appear here. If you want to access data and code written by other people, you'll need to install it as a *package*. An R package is simply a bunch of data, from functions, to help menus, to vignettes (examples), stored in one neat package.


```{r package, fig.cap= "An R package is light a lightbulb. First you need to order it with install.packages(). Then, every time you want to use it, you need to turn it on with library()", fig.margin = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/packagebulb.png"))
```


A package is like a lightbulb. In order to use it, you first need to order it to your house (i.e.; your computer) by *installing* it. Once you've installed a package, you never need to install it again. However, every time you want to actually use the package, you need to turn it on  by *loading* it. Here's how to do it.


### Installing a new package

Installing a package simply means downloading the package code onto your personal computer. There are two main ways to install new packages. The first, and most common, method is to download them from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CRAN is the central repository for R packages. To install a new R package from CRAN, you can simply run the code `install.packages("name")`, where "name" is the name of the package. For example, to download the `yarrr` package, which contains several data sets and functions we will use in this book, you should run the following:


```{r cran, fig.cap= "CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is the main source of R packages", fig.margin = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/cran.png"))
```




```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the yarrr package from CRAN
#   You only need to install a package once!
install.packages("yarrr")
```


When you run `install.packages("name")` R will download the package from CRAN. If everything works, you should see some information about where the package is being downloaded from, in addition to a progress bar.

```{r installingpackages, fig.cap= "When you install a new package, you'll see some random text like this you the download progress. You don't need to memorize this.", fig.margin = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/installingpackages.png"))
```


Like ordering a lightbulb, once you've installed a package on your computer you never need to install it again (unless you want to try to install a new version of the package). However, every time you want to use it, you need to turn it on by loading it.


### Loading a package

Once you've installed a package, it's on your computer. However, just because it's on your computer doesn't mean R is ready to use it. If you want to use something, like a function or dataset, from a package you *always* need to *load* the package in your R session first. Just like a lightbulb, you need to turn it on to use it!

To load a package, you use the `library()` function. For example, now that we've installed the `yarrr` package, we can load it with `library("yarrr")`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load the yarrr package so I can use it!
#   You have to load a package in every new R session!
library("yarrr")
```


Now that you've loaded the `yarrr` package, you can use any of its functions! One of the coolest functions in this package is called `pirateplot()`. Rather than telling you what a pirateplot is, let's just make one. Run the following code chunk to make your own pirateplot. Don't worry about the specifics of the code below, you'll learn more about how all this works later. For now, just run the code and marvel at your pirateplot.

```{r}
# Make a pirateplot using the pirateplot() function
#  from the yarrr package!

pirateplot(formula = weight ~ Time, 
           data = ChickWeight,
           pal = "xmen")
```

There is one way in R to temporarily load a package without using the `library()` function. To do this, you can simply use the notation `package::function` notation. This notation simply tells R to load the package just for this one chunk of code. For example, I could use the `pirateplot` function from `yarrr` package as follows:

```{r}
# Use the pirateplot() function without loading the yarrr package first
yarrr::pirateplot(formula = weight ~ Diet,
                  data = ChickWeight)
```


Again, you can think about the `package::function` method as a way to temporarily loading a package for a single line of code. One benefit of using the `package::function` notation is that it's immediately clear to anyone reading the code which package contains the function. However, a drawback is that if you are using a function from a package often, it forces you to constantly retype the package name. You can use whichever method makes sense for you.



## Cheatsheets and getting help


### R Cheatsheets

```{r rreferencecard, fig.cap= "The R reference card written by Tom Short is absolutely indispensable!", fig.margin = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/rreferencess.png"))
```

Over the course of this book, you will be learning *lots* of new functions. Wouldn't it be nice if someone created a Cheatsheet / Dictionary of many common R functions? Yes it would, and thankfully several friendly R programmers have done just that. Below is a table of some of them that I recommend. I highly encourage you to print these out and start highlighting functions as you learn them!

Here are some resources for R help and inspiration that I can highly recommend

1. http://www.r-bloggers.com: R bloggers is my go-to place to discover the latest and greatest with R.

2. http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com: Revolution analytics always has great R related material.

3. http://www.kaggle.com: Kaggle is a really cool website that posts data analysis challenges that anyone can try to solve. It also contains a wide range of real-world datasets and tutorials.

4. https://www.r-bloggers.com/learning-statistics-on-youtube/: If you like to learn with YouTube, this page contains many links to R related YouTube channels.

<!-- ## Reading and writing Code -->

<!-- In this book, R code is (almost) always presented in a separate gray box like this one: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # This is a code chunk! You should always be able to -->
<!-- #  copy and paste code chunks into R -->

<!-- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 -->

<!-- a <- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 -->

<!-- a -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is called a *code chunk*. You should always be able to directly copy and paste code chunks directly into R. If you copy a chunk and it does not work for you, it is most likely because the code refers to a package, function, or object that I defined in a previous chunk. If so, read back and look for a previous chunk that contains the missing definition. As you'll soon learn, lines that begin with \# are either comments or output from prior code that R will ignore. -->





<!--chapter:end:02-gettingstarted.Rmd-->

# Jump In! {#jumpin}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```



```{r, fig.cap= "Despite what you might find at family friendly waterparks -- this is NOT how real pirate swimming lessons look.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/pirateswimming.jpg"))
```


What's the first exercise on the first day of pirate swimming lessons? While it would be cute if they all had little inflatible pirate ships to swim around in -- unfortunately this is not the case. Instead, those baby pirates take a walk off their baby planks so they can get a taste of what they're in for. Turns out, learning R is the same way. Let's jump in. In this chapter, you'll see how easy it is to calculate basic statistics and create plots in R. Don't worry if the code you're running doesn't make immediate sense -- just marvel at how easy it is to do this in R!

In this section, we'll analyze a dataset called...wait for it...pirates! The dataset contains data from a survey of 1,000 pirates. The data is contained in the `yarrr` package, so make sure you've installed and loaded the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the yarrr package
install.packages('yarrr')

# Load the package
library(yarrr)
```

## Exploring data

Next, we'll look at the help menu for the pirates dataset using the question mark `?pirates`. When you run this, you should see a small help window open up in RStudio that gives you some information about the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?pirates
```


First, let's take a look at the first few rows of the dataset using the `head()` function. This will show you the first few rows of the data.

```{r}
# Look at the first few rows of the data
head(pirates)
```

You can look at the names of the columns in the dataset with the `names()` function

```{r}
# What are the names of the columns?
names(pirates)
```

Finally, you can also view the entire dataset in a separate window using the `View()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# View the entire dataset in a new window
View(pirates)
```


## Descriptive statistics

Now let's calculate some basic statistics on the entire dataset. We'll calculate the mean age, maximum height, and number of pirates of each sex:

```{r}
# What is the mean age?
mean(pirates$age)

# What was the tallest pirate?
max(pirates$height)

# How many pirates are there of each sex?
table(pirates$sex)
```

Now, let's calculate statistics for different groups of pirates. For example, the following code will use the `aggregate()` function to calculate the mean age of pirates, separately for each sex.

```{r}
# Calculate the mean age, separately for each sex
aggregate(formula = age ~ sex,
          data = pirates,
          FUN = mean)
```


## Plotting

Cool stuff, now let's make a plot! We'll plot the relationship between pirate's height and weight using the `plot()` function. We'll also include a blue regression line to measure the strength of the relationship.

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
plot(x = pirates$height,        # X coordinates
     y = pirates$weight,        # y-coordinates
     main = 'My first scatterplot of pirate data!',
     xlab = 'Height (in cm)',   # x-axis label
     ylab = 'Weight (in kg)',   # y-axis label
     pch = 16,                  # Filled circles
     col = gray(.0, .1))        # Transparent gray

grid()        # Add gridlines

# Create a linear regression model
model <- lm(formula = weight ~ height, 
            data = pirates)

abline(model, col = 'blue')      # Add regression to plot
```


Scatterplots are great for showing the relationship between two continuous variables, but what if your independent variable is not continuous? In this case, pirateplots are a good option. Let's create a pirateplot using the `pirateplot()` function to show the distribution of pirate's age based on their favorite sword:

```{r}
pirateplot(formula = age ~ sword.type, 
           data = pirates,
           main = "Pirateplot of ages by favorite sword")
```


## Hypothesis tests

Now, let's do some basic hypothesis tests. First, let's conduct a two-sample t-test to see if there is a significant difference between the ages of pirates who do wear a headband, and those who do not:

```{r}
# Age by headband t-test
t.test(formula = age ~ headband,
       data = pirates,
       alternative = 'two.sided')
```

With a p-value of 0.7259, we don't have sufficient evidence say there is a difference in the men age of pirates who wear headbands and those that do not.

Next, let's test if there a significant correlation between a pirate's height and weight using the `cor.test()` function:

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ height + weight,
         data = pirates)
```

We got a p-value of `p < 2.2e-16`, that's scientific notation for `p < .00000000000000016` -- which is pretty much 0. Thus, we'd conclude that there is a significant (positive) relationship between a pirate's height and weight.

Now, let's do an ANOVA testing if there is a difference between the number of tattoos pirates have based on their favorite sword

```{r}
# Create tattoos model
tat.sword.lm <- lm(formula = tattoos ~ sword.type,
                   data = pirates)

# Get ANOVA table
anova(tat.sword.lm)
```

Sure enough, we see another very small p-value of `p < 2.2e-16`, suggesting that the number of tattoos pirate's have are different based on their favorite sword.

## Regression

Finally, let's run a regression analysis to see if a pirate's age, weight, and number of tattoos (s)he has predicts how many treasure chests he/she's found:

```{r}
# Create a linear regression model: DV = tchests, IV = age, weight, tattoos
tchests.model <- lm(formula = tchests ~ age + weight + tattoos,
                    data = pirates)

# Show summary statistics
summary(tchests.model)
```

It looks like the only significant predictor of the number of treasure chests that a pirate has found is his/her age. There does not seem to be significant effect of weight or tattoos.

## Bayesian Statistics

Now, let's repeat some of our previous analyses with Bayesian versions. First we'll install and load the \texttt{BayesFactor} package which contains the Bayesian statistics functions we'll use:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install and load the BayesFactor package
install.packages('BayesFactor')
library(BayesFactor)
```

Now that the packages is installed and loaded, we're good to go! Let's do a Bayesian version of our earlier t-test asking if pirates who wear a headband are older or younger than those who do not.

```{r}
# Bayesian t-test comparing the age of pirates with and without headbands
ttestBF(formula = age ~ headband,
        data = pirates)
```

It looks like we got a Bayes factor of 0.12 which is strong evidence *for* the null hypothesis (that the mean age does not differ between pirates with and without headbands)


## Wasn't that easy?!

Wait...wait...WAIT! Did you seriously just calculate descriptive statistics, a t-test, an ANOVA, and a regression, create a scatterplot and a pirateplot, AND do both a Bayesian t-test and regression analysis. Yup. Imagine how long it would have taken to explain how to do all that in SPSS. And while you haven't really learned how R works yet, I'd bet my beard that you could easily alter the previous code to do lots of other analyses. Of course, don't worry if some or all of the previous code didn't make sense. Soon...it will all be clear.

Now that you've jumped in, let's learn how to swim.



<!--chapter:end:03-jumpin.Rmd-->

# The Basics {#basics}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```


If you're like most people, you think of R as a statistics program. However, while R is definitely the coolest, most badass, pirate-y way to conduct statistics -- it's not really a program. Rather, it's a programming \textit{language} that was written by and for statisticians. To learn more about the history of R...just...you know...Google it.


```{r, fig.cap= "Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemen. You have these two pirates to thank for creating R! You might not think much of them now, but by the end of this book there's a good chance you'll be dressing up as one of them on Halloween.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/rauthors.jpg"))
```


In this chapter, we'll go over the basics of the R language and the RStudio programming environment.


## The command-line (Console)


```{r, fig.cap= "Yep. R is really just a fancy calculator. This R programming device was found on a shipwreck on the Bodensee in Germany. I stole it from a museum and made a pretty sweet plot with it. But I don't want to show it to you.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/woodcalc.jpg"))
```


R code, on its own, is just text. You can write R code in a new script within R or RStudio, or in any text editor. Hell, you can write R code on Twitter if you want. However, just writing the code won't do the whole job -- in order for your code to be executed (aka, interpreted) you need to send it to R's \textit{command-line interpreter}. In RStudio, the command-line interpreter is called the Console.


```{r, fig.cap= "You can always type code directly into the command line to get an immediate response.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/commandline.png"))
```


In R, the command-line interpreter starts with the > symbol. This is called the \textit{prompt}. Why is it called the prompt? Well, it's ``prompting'' you to feed it with some R code. The fastest way to have R evaluate code is to type your R code directly into the command-line interpreter. For example, if you type \texttt{1+1} into the interpreter and hit enter you'll see the following


```{r}
1+1
```

As you can see, R returned the (thankfully correct) value of 2. You'll notice that the console also returns the text [1]. This is just telling you you the index of the value next to it. Don't worry about this for now, it will make more sense later. As you can see, R can, thankfully, do basic calculations. In fact, at its heart, R is technically just a fancy calculator. But that's like saying Michael Jordan is *just* a fancy ball bouncer or Donald Trump is *just* a orange with a dead fox on his head. It (and they), are much more than that.

## Writing R scripts in an editor

There are certainly many cases where it makes sense to type code directly into the console. For example, to open a help menu for a new function with the ? command, to take a quick look at a dataset with the `head()` function, or to do simple calculations like `1+1`, you should type directly into the console. However, the problem with writing all your code in the console is that nothing that you write will be saved. So if you make an error, or want to make a change to some earlier code, you have to type it all over again. Not very efficient. For this (and many more reasons), you'll should write any important code that you want to save as an R script. An R script is just a bunch of R code in a single file. You can write an R script in any text editor, but you should save it with the `.R` suffix to make it clear that it contains R code.} in an editor. 



In RStudio, you'll write your R code in the...wait for it...*Source* window. To start writing a new R script in RStudio, click File -- New File -- R Script.

**Shortcut!** To create a new script in R, you can also use the command--shift--N shortcut on Mac. I don't know what it is on PC...and I don't want to know.

When you open a new script, you'll see a blank page waiting for you to write as much R code as you'd like. In Figure \@ref(fig:editor), I have a new script called `examplescript` with a few random calculations.


```{r editor, fig.cap= "Here's how a new script looks in the editor window on RStudio. The code you type won't be executed until you send it to the console.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/sourcess.png"))
```

You can have several R scripts open in the source window in separate tabs (like I have above).

### Send code from an editor to the console

When you type code into an R script, you'll notice that, unlike typing code into the Console, nothing happens. In order for R to interpret the code, you need to send it from the Editor to the Console. There are a few ways to do this, here are the three most common ways:

1. Copy the code from the Editor (or anywhere that has valid R code), and paste it into the Console (using Command--V).

2. Highlight the code you want to run (with your mouse or by holding Shift), then use the Command--Return shortcut (see Figure \@ref(fig:commandreturn)).

3. Place the cursor on a single line you want to run, then use the Command--Return shortcut to run just that line.

```{r commandreturn, fig.cap= "Ah...the Command--Return shortcut (Control--Enter on PC) to send highlighted code from the Editor to the Console. Get used to this shortcut people. You're going to be using this a lot", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/commandreturn.jpg"))
```


99\% of the time, I use method 2, where I highlight the code I want, then use the Command--Return shortcut . However, method 3 is great for trouble-shooting code line-by-line.

## A brief style guide: Commenting and spacing

Like all programming languages, R isn't just meant to be read by a computer, it's also meant to be read by other humans -- or very well-trained dolphins. For this reason, it's important that your code looks nice and is understandable to other people and your future self. To keep things brief, I won't provide a complete style guide -- instead I'll focus on the two most critical aspects of good style: commenting and spacing.

For a list of recommendations on how to make your code easier to follow, check out Google's own company R Style guide at [https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)


```{r futureself, fig.cap= "As Stan discovered in season six of South Park, your future self is a lazy, possibly intoxicated moron. So do your future self a favor and make your code look nice. Also maybe go for a run once in a while.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/futureself.jpg"))
```


### Commenting code with the \# (pound) sign

Comments are completely ignored by R and are just there for whomever is reading the code. You can use comments to explain what a certain line of code is doing, or just to visually separate meaningful chunks of code from each other. Comments in R are designated by a \# (pound) sign. Whenever R encounters a \# sign, it will ignore **all** the code after the \# sign on that line. Additionally, in most coding editors (like RStudio) the editor will display comments in a separate color than standard R code to remind you that it's a comment:

Here is an example of a short script that is nicely commented. Try to make your scripts look like this!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Author: Pirate Jack
# Title: My nicely commented R Script
# Date: None today :(

# Step 1: Load the yarrr package
library(yarrr)

# Step 2: See the column names in the movies dataset
names(movies)

# Step 3: Calculations

# What percent of movies are sequels?
mean(movies$sequel, na.rm = T)

# How much did Pirate's of the Caribbean: On Strager Tides make?
movies$revenue.all[movies$name == 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides']
```



I cannot stress enough how important it is to comment your code! Trust me, even if you don't plan on sharing your code with anyone else, keep in mind that your future self will be reading it in the future. 


### Spacing

Howwouldyouliketoreadabookiftherewerenospacesbetweenwords?
I'mguessingyouwouldn't.
Soeverytimeyouwritecodewithoutproperspacing,rememberthissentence.

Commenting isn't the only way to make your code legible. It's important to make appropriate use of spaces and line breaks. For example, I include spaces between arithmetic operators (like =, + and -) and after commas (which we'll get to later). For example, look at the following code:

```{r pileofshit, fig.cap= "Don't make your code look like what a sick Triceratops with diarrhea left behind for Jeff Goldblum.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/pileofshit.png"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Shitty looking code
a<-(100+3)-2
mean(c(a/100,642564624.34))
t.test(formula=revenue.all~sequel,data=movies)
plot(x=movies$budget,y=movies$dvd.usa,main="myplot")
```

That code looks like shit. Don't write code like that. It makes my eyes hurt. Now, let's use some liberal amounts of commenting and spacing to make it look less shitty.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Some meaningless calculations. Not important

a <- (100 + 3) - 2
mean(c(a / 100, 642564624.34))

# t.test comparing revenue of sequels v non-sequels

t.test(formula = revenue.all ~ sequel,
       data = movies)

# A scatterplot of budget and dvd revenue. 
#  Hard to see a relationship

plot(x = movies$budget,
     y = movies$dvd.usa,
     main = "myplot")
```


See how much better that second chunk of code looks? Not only do the comments tell us the purpose behind the code, but there are spaces and line-breaks separating distinct elements.


## Objects and functions

To understand how R works, you need to know that R revolves around two things: objects and functions. Almost everything in R is either an object or a function. In the following code chunk, I'll define a simple object called `tattoos` using a function `c()`:

```{r}
# 1: Create a vector object called tattoos
tattoos <- c(4, 67, 23, 4, 10, 35)

# 2: Apply the mean() function to the tattoos object
mean(tattoos)
```

What is an object? An object is a thing -- like a number, a dataset, a summary statistic like a mean or standard deviation, or a statistical test. Objects come in many different shapes and sizes in R. There are simple objects like \textit{scalars} which represent single numbers, **vectors** (like our `tattoos` object above) which represent several numbers, more complex objects like **dataframes** which represent tables of data, and even more complex objects like **hypothesis tests** or **regression** which contain all sorts of statistical information.

Different types of objects have different *attributes*. For example, a vector of data has a length attribute (i.e.; how many numbers are in the vector), while a hypothesis test has many attributes such as a test-statistic and a p-value. Don't worry if this is a bit confusing now -- it will all become clearer when you meet these new objects in person in later chapters. For now, just know that objects in R are things, and different objects have different attributes.
 
What is a function? A function is a *procedure* that typically takes one or more objects as arguments (aka, inputs), does something with those objects, then returns a new object. For example, the `mean()` function we used above takes a vector object, like `tattoos`, of numeric data as an argument, calculates the arithmetic mean of those data, then returns a single number (a scalar) as a result.A great thing about R is that you can easily create your own functions that do whatever you want -- but we'll get to that much later in the book. Thankfully, R has hundreds (thousands?) of built-in functions that perform most of the basic analysis tasks you can think of.

99\% of the time you are using R, you will do the following: 1) Define objects. 2) Apply functions to those objects. 3) Repeat!. Seriously, that's about it. However, as you'll soon learn, the hard part is knowing how to define objects they way you want them, and knowing which function(s) will accomplish the task you want for your objects.

### Numbers versus characters

For the most part, objects in R come in one of two flavors: **numeric** and **character**. It is very important to keep these two separate as certain functions, like `mean()`, and `max()` will only work for numeric objects, while functions like `grep()` and `strtrim()` only work for character objects.

A numeric object is just a number like `1`, `10` or `3.14`. You don't have to do anything special to create a numeric object, just type it like you were using a calculator.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# These are all numeric objects
1
10
3.14
```

A **character** object is a name like `"Madisen"`, `"Brian"`, or `"University of Konstanz"`. To specify a character object, you need to include quotation marks `""` around the text.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# These are all character objects
"Madisen"
"Brian"
"10"
```

If you try to perform a function or operation meant for a numeric object on a character object (and vice-versa), R will yell at you. For example, here's what happens when I try to take the mean of the two character objects `"1"` and `"10"`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# This will return an error because the arguments are not numeric!
mean(c("1", "10"))
```
<div class="error">Warning message: argument is not numeric or logical, returning NA</div>

If I make sure that the arguments are numeric (by not including the quotation marks), I won't receive the error:

```{r}
# This is ok!
mean(c(1, 10))
```


### Creating new objects with <-

By now you know that you can use R to do simple calculations. But to really take advantage of R, you need to know how to create and manipulate objects. All of the data, analyses, and even plots, you use and create are, or can be, saved as objects in R. For example the `movies` dataset which we've used before is an object stored in the `yarrr` package. This object was defined in the `yarrr` package with the name `movies`. When you loaded the `yarrr` package with the `library('yarrr')` command, you told R to give you access to the `movies` object. Once the object was loaded, we could use it to calculate descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and to create plots.

To create new objects in R, you need to do *object assignment*. Object assignment is our way of storing information, such as a number or a statistical test, into something we can easily refer to later. This is a pretty big deal. Object assignment allows us to store data objects under relevant names which we can then use to slice and dice specific data objects anytime we'd like to.

To do an assignment, we use the almighty `<-` operator called *assign* To assign something to a new object (or to change an existing object), use the notation `object <- ...`}, where `object` is the new (or updated) object, and `...` is whatever you want to store in `object`. Let's start by creating a very simple object called `a` and assigning the value of 100 to it:

\marginnote{Good object names strike a balance between being easy to type (i.e.; short names) and interpret. If you have several datasets, it's probably not a good idea to name them \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} because you'll forget which is which. However, using long names like \texttt{March2015Group1OnlyFemales} will give you carpel tunnel syndrome.}


```{r}
# Create a new object called a with a value of 100
a <- 100
```


Once you run this code, you'll notice that R doesn't tell you anything. However, as long as you didn't type something wrong, R should now have a new object called `a` which contains the number 100. If you want to see the value, you need to call the object by just executing its name. This will print the value of the object to the console:

```{r}
# Print the object a
a
```

Now, R will print the value of `a` (in this case 100) to the console. If you try to evaluate an object that is not yet defined, R will return an error. For example, let's try to print the object `b` which we haven't yet defined:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b
```
<div class="error">Error: object 'b' not found</div>


As you can see, R yelled at us because the object `b` hasn't been defined yet.

Once you've defined an object, you can combine it with other objects using basic arithmetic. Let's create objects `a` and `b` and play around with them.

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 100

# What is a + b?
a + b

# Assign a + b to a new object (c)
c <- a + b

# What is c?
c
```



#### To change an object, you must assign it again!

Normally I try to avoid excessive emphasis, but because this next sentence is so important, I have to just go for it. Here it goes...

**To change an object, you \textit{must} assign it again!**

No matter what you do with an object, if you don't assign it again, it won't change. For example, let's say you have an object `z` with a value of 0. You'd like to add 1 to `z` in order to make it 1. To do this, you might want to just enter `z + 1` -- but that won't do the job. Here's what happens if you **don't** assign it again:

```{r}
z <- 0
z + 1
```

Ok! Now let's see the value of `z`

```{r}
z
```

Damn! As you can see, the value of z is still 0! What went wrong? Oh yeah...

**To change an object, you *must* assign it again!**


The problem is that when we wrote `z + 1` on the second line, R thought we just wanted it to calculate and print the value of `z + 1`, without storing the result as a new `z` object. If we want to actually update the value of `z`, we need to reassign the result back to `z` as follows:

```{r}
z <- 0
z <- z + 1  # Now I'm REALLY changing z
z
```


Phew, z is now 1. Because we used assignment, z has been updated. About freaking time.


### How to name objects

You can create object names using any combination of letters and a few special characters (like `.` and `_`). Here are some valid object names

```{r}
# Valid object names
group.mean <- 10.21
my.age <- 32
FavoritePirate <- "Jack Sparrow"
sum.1.to.5 <- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```


All the object names above are perfectly valid. Now, let's look at some examples of *invalid* object names. These object names are all invalid because they either contain spaces, start with numbers, or have invalid characters:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Invalid object names!
famale ages <- 50 # spaces
5experiment <- 50 # starts with a number
a! <- 50 # has an invalid character
```


If you try running the code above in R, you will receive a warning message starting with <div class="error">Error: unexpected symbol</div>. Anytime you see this warning in R, it almost always means that you have a naming error of some kind.

#### R is case-sensitive!

```{r datetext, fig.cap= "Like a text message, you should probably watch your use of capitalization in R.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/datetext.png"))
```


Like English, R is case-sensitive -- it R treats capital letters differently from lower-case letters. For example, the four following objects `Plunder`, `plunder` and `PLUNDER` are totally different objects in R:

```{r}
# These are all different objects
Plunder <- 1
plunder <- 100
PLUNDER <- 5
```

I try to avoid using too many capital letters in object names because they require me to hold the shift key. This may sound silly, but you'd be surprised how much easier it is to type `mydata` than `MyData` 100 times.



###Example: Pirates of The Caribbean

Let's do a more practical example -- we'll define an object called `blackpearl.usd` which has the global revenue of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl in U.S. dollars. A quick Google search showed me that the revenue was \$634,954,103. I'll create the new object using assignment:

```{r}
blackpearl.usd <- 634954103
```



Now, my fellow European pirates might want to know how much this is in Euros. Let's create a new object called `{blackpearl.eur` which converts our original value to Euros by multiplying the original amount by 0.88 (assuming 1 USD = 0.88 EUR)

```{r}
blackpearl.eur <- blackpearl.usd * 0.88
blackpearl.eur
```


It looks like the movie made 558,759,611 in Euros. Not bad. Now, let's see how much more Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest made compared to "Curse of the Black Pearl." Another Google search uncovered that Dead Man's Chest made \$1,066,215,812 (that wasn't a mistype, the freaking movie made over a billion dollars). 

```{r}
deadman.usd <- 1066215812

```

Now, I'll divide `deadman.usd` by `blackpearl.usd`:

```{r}
deadman.usd / blackpearl.usd
```


It looks like "Dead Man's Chest" made `r round(100 * round(deadman.usd / blackpearl.usd, 2), 2)`\% as much as "Curse of the Black Pearl" - not bad for two movies based off of a ride from Disneyland.




## Test your R might!


1. Create a new R script. Using comments, write your name, the date, and ''Testing my Chapter 2 R Might'' at the top of the script. Write your answers to the rest of these exercises on this script, and be sure to copy and paste the original questions using comments! Your script should \textit{only} contain valid R code and comments. 

2. Which (if any) of the following objects names is/are invalid?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
thisone <- 1
THISONE <- 2
1This <- 3
this.one <- 4
This.1 <- 5
ThIS.....ON...E <- 6
This!On!e <- 7
lkjasdfkjsdf <- 8
```



3. 2015 was a good year for pirate booty - your ship collected 100,800 gold coins. Create an object called \texttt{gold.in.2015} and assign the correct value to it.

4. Oops, during the last inspection we discovered that one of your pirates Skippy McGee hid 800 gold coins in his underwear. Go ahead and add those gold coins to the object `gold.in.2015`. Next, create an object called `plank.list` with the name of the pirate thief.

5. Look at the code below. What will R return after the third line? Make a prediction, then test the code yourself.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 10
a + 10
a
```

crew.ages.decade <- crew.ages / 10

# Earnings over first 10 days at sea
days <- 1:10
gold <- seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 10)
silver <- rep(50, times = 10)
total <- gold + silver
```

People are not objects. But R is full of them. Here are some of the basic ones.

## Scalars

The simplest object type in R is a **scalar**. A scalar object is just a single value like a number or a name. In the previous chapter we defined several scalar objects. Here are examples of numeric scalars:

```{r}
# Examples of numeric scalers
a <- 100
b <- 3 / 100
c <- (a + b) / b
```

Scalars don't have to be numeric, they can also be **characters** (also known as strings). In R, you denote characters using quotation marks. Here are examples of character scalars:

```{r}
# Examples of character scalers
d <- "ship"
e <- "cannon"
f <- "Do any modern armies still use cannons?"
```


As you can imagine, R treats numeric and character scalars differently. For example, while you can do basic arithmetic operations on numeric scalars -- they won't work on character scalars. If you try to perform numeric operations (like addition) on character scalars, you'll get an error like this one:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- "1"
b <- "2"
a + b
```
<div class="error">Error in a + b: non-numeric argument to binary operator</div>

If you see an error like this one, it means that you're trying to apply numeric operations to character objects. That's just sick and wrong.


##Vectors

Now let's move onto `vectors`. A vector object is just a combination of several scalars stored as a single object. For example, the numbers from one to ten could be a vector of length 10, and the characters in the English alphabet could be a vector of length 26. Like scalars, vectors can be either numeric or character (but not both!).

There are many ways to create vectors in R. Here are the methods we will cover in this chapter:


| Function| Example|Result |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|:----------|
|     `c(a, b, ...)`|    `c(1, 5, 9)` |`r c(1, 5, 9)`     |
|     `a:b`|    `1:5`|`r 1:5`    |
|     `seq(from, to, by, length.out)`|    `seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 2)`|`r seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 2)`     |
|     `rep(x, times, each, length.out)`|    `rep(c(7, 8), times = 2, each = 2)`|`r rep(c(7, 8), times = 2, each = 2)`     |

Table: Functions to create vectors.

The simplest way to create a vector is with the `c()` function. The c here stands for concatenate, which means "bring them together". The `c()` function takes several scalars as arguments, and returns a vector containing those objects. When using c(), place a comma in between the objects (scalars or vectors) you want to combine:

Let's use the `c()` function to create a vector called `a` containing the integers from 1 to 5.

```{r}
# Create an object a with the integers from 1 to 5
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the result
a
```


As you can see, R has stored all 5 numbers in the object `a`. Thanks R!

You can also create longer vectors by combining vectors you have already defined. Let's create a vector of the numbers from 1 to 10 by first generating a vector `a` from 1 to 5, and a vector `b` from 6 to 10 then combine them into a single vector `x`:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
b <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
x <- c(a, b)
x
```


You can also create character vectors by using the `c()` function to combine character scalars into character vectors:

```{r, fig.cap= "This is not a pipe. It is a character vector.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/magrittepipe.jpg"))
```


```{r}
char.vec <- c("Leci", "nest", "pas", "une", "pipe")
char.vec
```



While the `c()` function is the most straightforward way to create a vector, it's also one of the most tedious. For example, let's say you wanted to create a vector of all integers from 1 to 100. You definitely don't want to have to type all the numbers into a c() operator. Thankfully, R has many simple built-in functions for generating numeric vectors. Let's start with three of them: `a:b`, `seq()`, and `rep()`:

### a:b

The `a:b` function takes two numeric scalars `a` and `b` as arguments, and returns a vector of numbers from the starting point `a` to the ending point `b` in steps of 1.


Here are some examples of the `a:b` function in action. As you'll see, you can go backwards or forwards, or make sequences between non-integers:

```{r}
1:10
10:1
2.5:8.5
```




###seq()


| Argument| Definition|
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|     `from`|    The start of the sequence |
|     `to`|     The end of the sequence |
|     `by`|    The step-size of the sequence|
|     `length.out`|   The desired length of the final sequence (only use if you don't specify `by`)|


The `seq()` function is a more flexible version of `a:b`. Like `a:b`, `seq()` allows you to create a sequence from a starting number to an ending number. However, `seq()}`, has additional arguments that allow you to specify either the size of the steps between numbers, or the total length of the sequence:


The `seq()` function has two new arguments `by` and `length.out`. If you use the `by` argument, the sequence will be in steps of the input to the `by` argument:


```{r}
# Create the numbers from 1 to 10 in steps of 1
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

# Integers from 0 to 100 in steps of 10
seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 10)
```

If you use the `length.out` argument, the sequence will have length equal to `length.out`.

```{r}
# Create 10 numbers from 1 to 5
seq(from = 1, to = 5, length.out = 10)

# 3 numbers from 0 to 100
seq(from = 0, to = 100, length.out = 3)
```



###rep()

| Argument| Definition|
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|     `x`|    A scalar or vector of values to repeat |
|     `times`|     The number of times to repeat x |
|     `each`|    The number of times to repeat each value within x|
|     `length.out`|   The desired length of the final sequence|


```{r rep, fig.cap= "Not a good depiction of a rep in R.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/rep.jpg"))
```


The `rep()` function allows you to repeat a scalar (or vector) a specified number of times, or to a desired length. Let's do some reps.


```{r}
rep(x = 3, times = 10)
rep(x = c(1, 2), each = 3)
rep(x = 1:3, length.out = 10)
```

As you can see, you can can include an `a:b` call within a `rep()`!

You can even combine the `times` and `each` arguments within a single `rep()` function. For example, here's how to create the sequence {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3} with one call to `rep()`:

```{r}
rep(x = 1:3, each = 2, times = 2)
```



**Warning! Vectors contain either numbers or characters, not both**

A vector can only contain one type of scalar: either numeric or character. If you try to create a vector with numeric and character scalars, then R will convert *all* of the numeric scalars to characters. In the next code chunk, I'll create a new vector called `my.vec` that contains a mixture of numeric and character scalars.

```{r}
my.vec <- c("a", 1, "b", 2, "c", 3)
my.vec
```

As you can see from the output, `my.vec` is stored as a character vector where all the numbers are converted to characters.

## Generating random data

Because R is a language built for statistics, it contains many functions that allow you generate random data -- either from a vector of data that you specify (like Heads or Tails from a coin), or from an established *probability distribution*, like the Normal or Uniform distribution.

In the next section we'll go over the standard `sample()` function for drawing random values from a vector. We'll then cover some of the most commonly used probability distributions: Normal and Uniform.

### sample()

| Argument| Definition|
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------|
|     `x`|    A vector of outcomes you want to sample from. For example, to simulate coin flips, you'd enter `x = c("H", "T")` |
|     `size`|     The number of samples you want to draw. The default is the length of `x`.|
|     `replace`|    Should sampling be done with replacement? If FALSE (the default value), then each outcome in `x` can only be drawn once. If TRUE, then each outcome in `x` can be drawn multiple times.|
|     `prob`|   A vector of probabilities of the same length as `x` indicating how likely each outcome in `x` is. The vector of probabilities you give as an argument should add up to one. If you don't specify the `prob` argument, all outcomes will be equally likely.|

The `sample()` function allows you to draw random samples of elements (scalars) from a vector. For example, if you want to simulate the 100 flips of a fair coin, you can tell the sample function to sample 100 values from the vector ["Heads", "Tails"]. Or, if you need to randomly assign people to either a "Control" or "Test" condition in an experiment, you can randomly sample values from the vector ["Control", "Test"]:


Let's use `sample()` to draw 10 samples from a vector of integers from 1 to 10.


```{r}
# From the integers 1:10, draw 5 numbers
sample(x = 1:10, size  = 5)
```

#### replace = TRUE

If you don't specify the `replace` argument, R will assume that you are sampling *without* replacement. In other words, each element can only be sampled once. If you want to sample with replacement, use the `replace = TRUE` argument:

Think about replacement like drawing balls from a bag. Sampling *with* replacement (`replace = TRUE`) means that each time you draw a ball, you return the ball back into the bag before drawing another ball. Sampling *without* replacement (`replace = FALSE`) means that after you draw a ball, you remove that ball from the bag so you can never draw it again.

```{r}
# Draw 30 samples from the integers 1:5 with replacement
sample(x = 1:5, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```


If you try to draw a large sample from a vector \textit{without} replacement, R will return an error because it runs out of things to draw:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# You CAN'T draw 10 samples without replacement from
#  a vector with length 5
sample(x = 1:5, size = 10)
```
<div class="error">Error: cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'</div>


To fix this, just tell R that you want to sample with replacement:

```{r}
# You CAN draw 10 samples with replacement from a
#  vector of length 5
sample(x = 1:5, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```


To specify how likely each element in the vector `x` should be selected, use the `prob` argument. The length of the `prob` argument should be as long as the `x` argument. For example, let's draw 10 samples (with replacement) from the vector ["a", "b"], but we'll make the probability of selecting "a" to be .90, and the probability of selecting "b" to be .10

```{r}
sample(x = c("a", "b"), 
       prob = c(.9, .1),
       size = 10, 
       replace = TRUE)
```


#### Ex: Simulating coin flips

Let's simulate 10 flips of a fair coin, were the probably of getting either a Head or Tail is .50. Because all values are equally likely, we don't need to specify the `prob` argument

```{r}
sample(x = c("H", "T"), # The possible values of the coin
       size = 10,  # 10 flips
       replace = TRUE) # Sampling with replacement
```

Now let's change it by simulating flips of a biased coin, where the probability of Heads is 0.8, and the probability of Tails is 0.2. Because the probabilities of each outcome are no longer equal, we'll need to specify them with the `prob` argument:

```{r}
sample(x = c("H", "T"),
       prob = c(.8, .2), # Make the coin biased for Heads
       size = 10,
       replace = TRUE)
```

As you can see, our function returned a vector of 10 values corresponding to our sample size of 10.

#### Ex: Coins from a chest

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(3, 3, 3, 3))
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt = "n",
     yaxt = "n", type = "n",
     main = "Chest of 20 Gold, 30 Silver,\nand 50 Bronze Coins")

points(runif(100, .1, .9),
       runif(100, .1, .9),
       pch = 21, cex = 3,
       bg = c(rep("gold", 20),
              rep("gray94", 30),
              rep("chocolate", 50))
       )
```


Now, let's sample drawing coins from a treasure chest Let's say the chest has 100 coins: 20 gold, 30 silver, and 50 bronze. Let's draw 10 random coins from this chest.

```{r}
# Create chest with the 100 coins

chest <- c(rep("gold", 20),
         rep("silver", 30),
         rep("bronze", 50))

# Draw 10 coins from the chest
sample(x = chest,
       size = 10)
```

The output of the \texttt{sample()} function above is a vector of 10 strings indicating the type of coin we drew on each sample. And like any random sampling function, this code will likely give you different results every time you run it! See how long it takes you to get 10 gold coins...


In the next section, we'll cover how to generate random data from specified *probability distributions*. What is a probability distribution? Well, it's simply an equation -- also called a likelihood function -- that indicates how likely certain numerical values are to be drawn.

We can use probability distributions to represent different types of data. For example, imagine you need to hire a new group of pirates for your crew. You have the option of hiring people form one of two different pirate training colleges that produce pirates of varying quality. One college "Pirate Training Unlimited" might tend to pirates that are generally ok - never great but never terrible. While another college "Unlimited Pirate Training" might produce pirates with a wide variety of quality, from very low to very high. In Figure~\ref{fig:piratecollege} I plotted 5 example pirates from each college, where each pirate is shown as a ball with a number written on it. As you can see, pirates from PTU all tend to be clustered between 40 and 60 (not terrible but not great), while pirates from UPT are all over the map, from 0 to 100. We can use probability distributions (in this case, the uniform distribution) to mathematically define how likely any possible value is to be drawn at random from a distribution. We could describe Pirate Training Unlimited with a uniform distribution with a small range, and Unlimited Pirate Training with a second uniform distribution with a wide range.


```{r piratecollege, fig.cap = "Sampling 5 potential pirates from two different pirate colleges. Pirate Training Unlimited (PTU) consistently produces average pirates (with scores between 40 and 60), while Unlimited Pirate Training (UPT), produces a wide range of pirates from 0 to 100.", echo = FALSE}
# Create blank plot
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100),
     xlab = "Pirate Quality", ylab = "", type = "n",
     main = "Two different Pirate colleges", yaxt = "n")

# Set colors
col.vec <- yarrr::piratepal(palette = "nemo")

text(50, 90, "Pirate Training Unlimited", font = 3)
ptu <- runif(n = 5, min = 40, max = 60)
points(ptu, rep(75, 5), pch = 21, bg = col.vec[1], cex = 3)
text(ptu, rep(75, 5), round(ptu, 0))
segments(40, 65, 60, 65, col = col.vec[1], lwd = 4)

text(50, 40, "Unlimited Pirate Training", font = 3)
upt <- runif(n = 5, min = 10, max = 90)
points(upt, rep(25, 5), pch = 21, bg = col.vec[2], cex = 3)
text(upt, rep(25, 5), round(upt, 0))
segments(10, 15, 90, 15, col = col.vec[2], lwd = 4)
```

In the next two sections, I'll cover the two most common distributions: The Normal and the Uniform. However, R contains many more distributions than just these two. To see them all, look at the help menu for Distributions:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# See all distributions included in Base R
?Distributions
```

### Normal (Gaussian)


```{r normaldist, fig.cap = "Three different normal distributions with different means and standard deviations", echo = FALSE}
# Create blank plot
plot(1, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = "x", ylab = "dnorm(x)", type = "n",
     main = "Three Normal Distributions", bty = "n")

f1 <- function(x) {dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)}
f2 <- function(x) {dnorm(x, mean = -2, sd = .5)}
f3 <- function(x) {dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd = 2)}

# Set colors
col.vec <- yarrr::piratepal("southpark")

curve(f1, from = -5, to = 5, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[1], lwd = 3)
curve(f2, from = -5, to = 5, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[2], lwd = 3)
curve(f3, from = -5, to = 5, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[3], lwd = 3)

legend(x = 0, y = 1,
       legend = c(expression(paste(mu == 0, ", ", sigma == 1)),
                  expression(paste(mu == -2, ", ", sigma == .5)),
                  expression(paste(mu == 1, ", ", sigma == 2))),
       lwd = rep(3, 3),
       col = col.vec[1:3],
       bty = "n")
```

| Argument| Definition|
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------|
|     `n`|     The number of observations to draw from the distribution.|
|     `mean`|      The mean of the distribution.|
|     `sd`|     The standard deviation of the distribution.|


The Normal (a.k.a "Gaussian") distribution is probably the most important distribution in all of statistics. The Normal distribution is bell-shaped, and has two parameters: a mean and a standard deviation. To generate samples from a normal distribution in R, we use the function `rnorm()`



```{r}
# 5 samples from a Normal dist with mean = 0, sd = 1
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# 3 samples from a Normal dist with mean = -10, sd = 15
rnorm(n = 3, mean = -10, sd = 15)
```

Again, because the sampling is done randomly, you'll get different values each time you run `rnorm()` 

### Uniform


```{r uniformdist, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The Uniform distribution - known colloquially as the Anthony Davis distribution."}
plot(1, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(0, 1.25), 
     main = "3 Uniform Distributions",
     xlab = "x", ylab = "Density", type = "n", bty = "n")

f1 <- function(x) {dunif(x, min = -1, max = 1)}
f2 <- function(x) {dunif(x, min = -4, max = -3)}
f3 <- function(x) {dunif(x, min = -2, max = 4)}

col.vec <- yarrr::piratepal("google")

curve(f1, from = -1, to = 1, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[1], lwd = 3)
segments(c(-1, 1), c(0, 0), c(-1, 1), c(f1(-1), f1(1)), lty = 2, col = col.vec[1])
curve(f2, from = -4, to = -3, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[2], lwd = 3)
segments(c(-4, -3), c(0, 0), c(-4, -3), c(f2(-4), f2(-3)), lty = 2, col = col.vec[2])
curve(f3, from = -2, to = 4, add = TRUE, col = col.vec[3], lwd = 3)
segments(c(-2, 4), c(0, 0), c(-2, 4), c(f3(-2), f3(4)), lty = 2, col = col.vec[3])

# Add Legend
legend(x = -2, y = 1.2,
       legend = c("Min = -1, Max = +1",
                  "Min = -4, Max = -3",
                  "Min = -2, Max = +4"),
       lwd = rep(3, 3),
       col = col.vec[1:3],
       bty = "n")

```




Next, let's move on to the Uniform distribution. The Uniform distribution gives equal probability to all values between its minimum and maximum values. In other words, everything between its lower and upper bounds are equally likely to occur. To generate samples from a uniform distribution,use the function `runif()`, the function has 3 arguments:


| Argument| Definition|
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------|
|     `n`|     The number of observations to draw from the distribution.|
|     `min`|     The lower bound of the Uniform distribution from which samples are drawn|
|     `max`|    The upper bound of the Uniform distribution from which samples are drawn|

Here are some samples from two different Uniform distributions:
```{r}
# 5 samples from Uniform dist with bounds at 0 and 1
runif(n = 5, min = 0, max = 1)

# 10 samples from Uniform dist with bounds at -100 and +100
runif(n = 10, min = -100, max = 100)
```



### Notes on random samples

#### Random samples will always change

Every time you draw a sample from a probability distribution, you'll (likely) get a different result. For example, see what happens when I run the following two commands (you'll learn the \texttt{rnorm()} function on the next page...)

```{r}
# Draw a sample of size 5 from a normal distribution with mean 100 and sd 10
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 100, sd = 10)

# Do it again!
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 100, sd = 10)
```

As you can see, the exact same code produced different results -- and that's exactly what we want! Each time you run `rnorm()`, or another distribution function, you'll get a new random sample.

#### Use `set.seed()` to control random samples


There will be cases where you will want to exert some control over the random samples that R produces from sampling functions. For example, you may want to create a reproducible example of some code that anyone else can replicate exactly. To do this, use the `set.seed()` function. Using `set.seed()` will force R to produce consistent random samples at any time on any computer.

In the code below I'll set the sampling seed to 100 with `set.seed(100)`. I'll then run `rnorm()` twice. The results will always be consistent (because we fixed the sampling seed).

```{r}
# Fix sampling seed to 100, so the next sampling functions
#   always produce the same values
set.seed(100)

# The result will always be -0.5022, 0.1315, -0.0789
rnorm(3, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# The result will always be 0.887, 0.117, 0.319
rnorm(3, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


Try running the same code on your machine and you'll see the exact same samples that I got above. Oh and the value of 100 I used above in `set.seed(100)` is totally arbitrary -- you can set the seed to any integer you want. I just happen to like how `set.seed(100)` looks in my code.

## Test your R might!


1. Create the vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] in three ways: once using `c()`, once using `a:b`, and once using `seq()`.

2. Create the vector [2.1, 4.1, 6.1, 8.1] in two ways, once using `c()` and once using `seq()`

3. Create the vector [0, 5, 10, 15] in 3 ways: using `c()`, `seq()` with a `by` argument, and `seq()` with a `length.out` argument.

4. Create the vector [101, 102, 103, 200, 205, 210, 1000, 1100, 1200] using a combination of the `c()` and `seq()` functions

5. A new batch of 100 pirates are boarding your ship and need new swords. You have 10 scimitars, 40 broadswords, and 50 cutlasses that you need to distribute evenly to the 100 pirates as they board. Create a vector of length 100 where there is 1 scimitar, 4 broadswords, and 5 cutlasses in each group of 10. That is, in the first 10 elements there should be exactly 1 scimitar, 4 broadswords and 5 cutlasses. The next 10 elements should also have the same number of each sword (and so on).

6. Create a vector that repeats the integers from 1 to 5, 10 times. That is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]. The length of the vector should be 50!

7. Now, create the same vector as before, but this time repeat 1, 10 times, then 2, 10 times, etc., That is [1, 1, 1, ..., 2, 2, 2, ..., ... 5, 5, 5]. The length of the vector should also be 50

8. Create a vector containing 50 samples from a Normal distribution with a population mean of 20 and standard deviation of 2.

9. Create a vector containing 25 samples from a Uniform distribution with a lower bound of -100 and an upper bound of -50.

# 10 students from two different classes took two exams.
#  Here are three vectors showing the data
midterm <- c(62, 68, 75, 79, 55, 62, 89, 76, 45, 67)
final <- c(78, 72, 97, 82, 60, 83, 92, 73, 50, 88)

```


## Arithmetic operations on vectors

So far, you know how to do basic arithmetic operations like + (addition), - (subtraction), and * (multiplication) on scalars. Thankfully, R makes it just as easy to do arithmetic operations on numeric vectors:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
b <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

a + 100
a + b
(a + b) / 10
```

If you do an operation on a vector with a scalar, R will apply the scalar to each element in the vector. For example, if you have a vector and want to add 10 to each element in the vector, just add the vector and scalar objects. Let's create a vector with the integers from 1 to 10, and add then add 100 to each element:

```{r}
# Take the integers from 1 to 10, then add 100 to each
1:10 + 100
```


As you can see, the result is [1 + 100, 2 + 100, ... 10 + 100]. Of course, we could have made this vector with the `a:b` function like this: `101:110`, but you get the idea.

Of course, this doesn't only work with addition...oh no. Let's try division, multiplication, and exponents. Let's create a vector `a` with the integers from 1 to 10 and then change it up:

```{r}
a <- 1:10
a / 100
a ^ 2
```


Again, if you perform an algebraic operation on a vector with a scalar, R will just apply the operation to every element in the vector.



### Basic math with multiple vectors

What if you want to do some operation on two vectors of the same length? Easy. Just apply the operation to both vectors. R will then combine them element--by--element. For example, if you add the vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the vector [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the resulting vector will have the values [1 + 5, 2 + 4, 3 + 3, 4 + 2, 5 + 1] = [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) + c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

```


Let's create two vectors a and b where each vector contains the integers from 1 to 5. We'll then create two new vectors `ab.sum`, the sum of the two vectors and `ab.diff`, the difference of the two vectors, and `ab.prod`, the product of the two vectors:

```{r}
a <- 1:5
b <- 1:5

ab.sum <- a + b
ab.diff <- a - b
ab.prod <- a * b

ab.sum
ab.diff
ab.prod
```




### Ex: Pirate Bake Sale

```{r, fig.cap= "", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/piratecookies.jpg"))
```


Let's say you had a bake sale on your ship where 5 pirates sold both pies and cookies. You could record the total number of pies and cookies sold in two vectors:

```{r}
pies <- c(3, 6, 2, 10, 4)
cookies <- c(70, 40, 40, 200, 60)
```

Now, let's say you want to know how many total items each pirate sold. You can do this by just adding the two vectors:

```{r}
total.sold <- pies + cookies
total.sold
```


Crazy.



## Summary statistics


Ok, now that we can create vectors, let's learn the basic descriptive statistics functions. We'll start with functions that apply to continuous data. Continuous data is data that, generally speaking, can take on an infinite number of values. Height and weight are good examples of continuous data. Table \@ref(tab:continuousvectorfunctiontable) contains common functions for continuous, numeric vectors. Each of them takes a numeric vector as an argument, and returns either a scalar (or in the case of `summary()`, a `table`) as a result.



| Function| Example|Result |
|:-------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
|     `sum(x), product(x)`|    `sum(1:10)` |`r sum(1:10)`     |
|     `min(x), max(x)`|    `min(1:10)`|`r min(1:10)`    |
|     `mean(x), median(x)`|    `mean(1:10)`     | `r mean(1:10)` |
|     `sd(x), var(x), range(x)`|    `sd(1:10)` | `r sd(1:10)` |
|     `quantile(x, probs)`|    `quantile(1:10, probs = .2)`|`r quantile(1:10, probs = .2)`     |
|     `summary(x)`|    `summary(1:10)`|`Min = 1.00. 1st Qu. = 3.25, Median = 5.50, Mean = 5.50, 3rd Qu. = 7.75, Max = 10.0`     |

Table: (\#tab:continuousvectorfunctiontable) Summary statistic functions for continuous data.


Let's calculate some descriptive statistics from some pirate related data. I'll create a vector called `x` that contains the number of tattoos from 10 random pirates.

```{r}
tattoos <- c(4, 50, 2, 39, 4, 20, 4, 8, 10, 100)
```

Now, we can calculate several descriptive statistics on this vector by using the summary statistics functions:

```{r}
min(tattoos)
mean(tattoos)
sd(tattoos)
```


### length()

```{r, fig.cap= "According to this article published in 2015 in Plos One, when it comes to people, length may matter for some. But trust me, for vectors it always does.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/penissize.png"))
```

Vectors have one dimension: their length. Later on, when you combine vectors into more higher dimensional objects, like matrices and dataframes, you will need to make sure that all the vectors you combine have the same length. But, when you want to know the length of a vector, don't stare at your computer screen and count the elements one by one! (That said, I must admit that I still do this sometimes...). Instead, use `length()` function. The `length()` function takes a vector as an argument, and returns a scalar representing the number of elements in the vector:

```{r}
a <- 1:10
length(a)  # How many elements are in a?

b <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, length.out = 20)
length(b)  # How many elements are in b?

length(c("This", "character", "vector", "has", "six", "elements."))
length("This character scalar has just one element.")
```

Get used to the `length()` function people, you'll be using it a lot!




### Additional numeric vector functions

Table \@ref(tab:morenumericfunctions) contains additional functions that you will find useful when managing numeric vectors:

| Function| Description | Example|Result |
|:------------|:------------------|:-------------------------|:----------|
|     `round(x, digits)`|  Round elements in x to `digits` digits |   `round(c(2.231, 3.1415), digits = 1)` |`r round(c(2.231, 3.1415), digits = 1)`     |
|     `ceiling(x), floor(x)`|  Round elements x to the next highest (or lowest) integer |  `ceiling(c(5.1, 7.9))`| `r ceiling(c(5.1, 7.9))`|
|     `x %% y`|  Modular arithmetic (ie. x mod y) |  `7 %% 3`|`r 7 %% 3` |    

Table: (\#tab:morenumericfunctions) Vector summary functions for continuous data.



### Sample statistics from random samples

Now that you know how to calculate summary statistics, let's take a closer look at how R draws random samples using the `rnorm()` and `runif()` functions. In the next code chunk, I'll calculate some summary statistics from a vector of 5 values from a Normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 5. I'll then calculate summary statistics from this sample using `mean()` and `sd()`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(100)
```

```{r}
# 5 samples from a Normal dist with mean = 10 and sd = 5
x <- rnorm(n = 5, mean = 10, sd = 5)

# What are the mean and standard deviation of the sample?
mean(x)
sd(x)
```


As you can see, the mean and standard deviation of our sample vector are close to the population values of 10 and 5 -- but they aren't exactly the same because these are sample data. If we take a much larger sample (say, 100,000), the sample statistics should get much closer to the population values:

```{r}
# 100,000 samples from a Normal dist with mean = 10, sd = 5
y <- rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 10, sd = 5)

mean(y)
sd(y)
```


Yep, sure enough our new sample y (containing 100,000 values) has a sample mean and standard deviation much closer (almost identical) to the population values than our sample x (containing only 5 values). This is an example of what is called the law of large numbers. Google it.


## Counting statistics

Next, we'll move on to common counting functions for vectors with discrete or non-numeric data. Discrete data are those like gender, occupation, and monkey farts, that only allow for a finite (or at least, plausibly finite) set of responses. Common functions for discrete vectors are in Table \@ref(tab:discretevectorfunctiontable). Each of these vectors takes a vector as an argument -- however, unlike the previous functions we looked at, the used as arguments to these functions can be either numeric or character.


| Function| Description | Example|Result |
|:----------|:--------------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------|
|     `unique(x)`|  Returns a vector of all unique values. |   `unique(c(1, 1, 2, 10))` |`r unique(c(1, 1, 2, 10))`     |
|     `table(x, exclude)`|  Returns a table showing all the unique values as well as a count of each occurrence. To include a count of NA values, include the argument `exclude = NULL` |  `table(c("a", "a", "b", "c"))`|` 2-"a", 1-"b", 1-"c"`    |

Table: (\#tab:discretevectorfunctiontable) Counting functions for discrete data.


Let's test these functions by starting with two vectors of discrete data:

```{r}
vec <- c(1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 10, 10, 10)
gender <- c("M", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F")
```



The function `unique(x)` will tell you all the unique values in the vector, but won't tell you anything about how often each value occurs.

```{r}
unique(vec)
unique(gender)
```



The function `table()` does the same thing as `unique()`, but goes a step further in telling you how often each of the unique values occurs:

```{r}
table(vec)
table(gender)
```


If you want to get a table of percentages instead of counts, you can just divide the result of the `table()` function by the sum of the result:

```{r}
table(vec) / sum(table(vec))
table(gender) / sum(table(gender))
```

## Missing (NA) values

In R, missing data are coded as NA. In real datasets, NA values turn up all the time. Unfortunately, most descriptive statistics functions will freak out if there is a missing (NA) value in the data. For example, the following code will return NA as a result because there is an NA value in the data vector:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 5, NA, 2, 10)
mean(a)
```

Thankfully, there's a way we can work around this. To tell a descriptive statistic function to ignore missing (NA) values, include the argument `na.rm = TRUE` in the function. This argument explicitly tells the function to ignore NA values. Let's try calculating the mean of the vector `a` again, this time with the additional`na.rm = TRUE` argument:

```{r}
mean(a, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Now, the function ignored the NA value and returned the mean of the remaining data. While this may seem trivial now (why did we include an NA value in the vector if we wanted to ignore it?!), it will be become very important when we apply the function to real data which, very often, contains missing values.





## Standardization (z-score)

A common task in statistics is to standardize variables -- also known as calculating z-scores. The purpose of standardizing a vector is to put it on a common scale which allows you to compare it to other (standardized) variables. To standardize a vector, you simply subtract the vector by its mean, and then divide the result by the vector's standard deviation. 

If the concept of z-scores is new to you -- don't worry. In the next worked example, you'll see how it can help you compare two sets of data. But for now, let's see how easy it is to standardize a vector using basic arithmetic.

Let's say you have a vector a containing some data. We'll assign the vector to a new object called `a` then calculate the mean and standard deviation with the `mean()` and `sd()` functions:

```{r}
a <- c(5, 3, 7, 5, 5, 3, 4)
mean(a)
sd(a)
```

Ok. Now we'll create a new vector called `a.z` which is a standardized version of a. To do this, we'll simply subtract the mean of the vector, then divide by the standard deviation.

```{r}
a.z <- (a - mean(a)) / sd(a)
```

Now let's look at the standardized values:

```{r}
a.z
```

The mean of `a.z` should now be 0, and the standard deviation of `a.z` should now be 1. Let's make sure:

```{r}
mean(a.z)
sd(a.z)
```


Sweet. Oh, don't worry that the mean of `a.z` doesn't look like exactly zero. Using non-scientific notation, the result is 0.000000000000000198. For all intents and purposes, that's 0. The reason the result is not exactly 0 is due to computer science theoretical reasons that I cannot explain (because I don't understand them).




### Ex: Evaluating a competition


Your gluten-intolerant first mate just perished in a tragic soy sauce incident and it's time to promote another member of your crew to the newly vacated position. Of course, only two qualities really matter for a pirate: rope-climbing, and grogg drinking. Therefore, to see which of your crew deserves the promotion, you decide to hold a climbing and drinking competition. In the climbing competition, you measure how many feet of rope a pirate can climb in an hour. In the drinking competition, you measure how many mugs of grogg they can drink in a minute. Five pirates volunteer for the competition -- here are their results:

```{r echo = FALSE}
competition <- data.frame("pirate" = c("Heidi", "Andrew", "Becki", "Madisen", "David"),
                          grogg =  c(12, 8, 1, 6, 2),
                          climbing = c(100, 520, 430, 200, 700))

knitr::kable(competition, caption = "Scores from a pirate competition")
```

We can represent the main results with two vectors `grogg` and `climbing`:

```{r}
grogg <- c(12, 8, 1, 6, 2)
climbing <- c(100, 520, 430, 200, 700)
```

Now you've got the data, but there's a problem: the scales of the numbers are very different. While the grogg numbers range from 1 to 12, the climbing numbers have a much larger range from 100 to 700. This makes it difficult to compare the two sets of numbers directly.

To solve this problem, we'll use standardization. Let's create new standardized vectors called `grogg.z` and `climbing.z`

```{r}
grogg.z <- (grogg - mean(grogg)) / sd(grogg)
climbing.z <- (climbing - mean(climbing)) / sd(climbing)
```

Now let's look at the final results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(digits = 2)
```


```{r}
grogg.z
climbing.z
```

It looks like there were two outstanding performances in particular. In the grogg drinking competition, the first pirate (Heidi) had a z-score of 1.4. We can interpret this by saying that Heidi drank 1.4 more standard deviations of mugs of grogg than the average pirate. In the climbing competition, the fifth pirate (David) had a z-score of 1.3. Here, we would conclude that David climbed 1.3 standard deviations more than the average pirate.

But which pirate was the best on average across both events? To answer this, let's create a combined z-score for each pirate which calculates the average z-scores for each pirate across the two events. We'll do this by adding two performances and dividing by two. This will tell us, how good, on average, each pirate did relative to her fellow pirates.

```{r}
average.z <- (grogg.z + (climbing.z)) / 2
```


Let's look at the result:

```{r}
round(average.z, 1)
```


The highest average z-score belongs to the second pirate (Andrew) who had an average z-score value of 0.5. The first and last pirates, who did well in one event, seemed to have done poorly in the other event.

Moral of the story: promote the pirate who can drink *and* climb.

## Test your R Might!

1. Create a vector that shows the square root of the integers from 1 to 10.

2. Renata thinks that she finds more treasure when she's had a mug of grogg than when she doesn't. To test this, she recorded how much treasure she found over 7 days without drinking any grogg (ie., sober), and then did the same over 7 days while drinking grogg (ie., drunk). Here are her results:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renata.score <- data.frame(
                          day = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"),
                          sober = c(2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 5),
                           drunk = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2))

knitr::kable(renata.score, caption = "Renata's treasure haul when she was sober and when she was drunk")
```

How much treasure did Renata find on average whe she was sober? What about when she was drunk?

3. Using Renata's data again, create a new vector called `difference` that shows how much more treasure Renata found when she was drunk and when she was not. What was the mean, median, and standard deviation of the difference?

4. There's an old parable that goes something like this. A man does some work for a king and needs to be paid. Because the man loves rice (who doesn't?!), the man offers the king two different ways that he can be paid. *You can either pay me 100 kilograms of rice, or, you can pay me as follows: get a chessboard and put one grain of rice in the top left square. Then put 2 grains of rice on the next square, followed by 4 grains on the next, 8 grains on the next...and so on, where the amount of rice doubles on each square, until you get to the last square. When you are finished, give me all the grains of rice that would (in theory), fit on the chessboard.* The king, sensing that the man was an idiot for making such a stupid offer, immediately accepts the second option. He summons a chessboard, and begins counting out grains of rice one by one... Assuming that there are 64 squares on a chessboard, calculate how many grains of rice the main will receive. If one grain of rice weights 1/64000 kilograms, how many kilograms of rice did he get? *Hint: If you have trouble coming up with the answer, imagine how many grains are on the first, second, third and fourth squares, then try to create the vector that shows the number of grains on each square. Once you come up with that vector, you can easily calculate the final answer with the `sum()` function.*

sum(boat.colors == "pink")

# What percent of boats were older than 100 years old?
mean(boat.ages < 100)
```


By now you should be a whiz at applying functions like `mean()` and `table()` to vectors. However, in many analyses, you won't want to calculate statistics of an entire vector. Instead, you will want to access specific *subsets* of values of a vector based on some criteria. For example, you may want to access values in a specific location in the vector (i.e.; the first 10 elements) or based on some criteria within that vector (i.e.; all values greater than 0), or based on criterion from values in a *different* vector (e.g.; All values of age where sex is Female). To access specific values of a vector in R, we use *indexing* using brackets `[]`. In general, whatever you put inside the brackets, tells R which values of the vector object you want. There are two main ways that you can use indexing to access subsets of data in a vector: numerical and logical indexing.


##Numerical Indexing

With numerical indexing, you enter a vector of integers corresponding to the values in the vector you want to access in the form `a[index]`, where `a` is the vector, and `index` is a vector of index values. For example, let's use numerical indexing to get values from our boat vectors.

```{r}
# What is the first boat name?
boat.names[1]

# What are the first five boat colors?
boat.colors[1:5]

# What is every second boat age?
boat.ages[seq(1, 5, by = 2)]
```


You can use any indexing vector as long as it contains integers. You can even access the same elements multiple times:

```{r}
# What is the first boat age (3 times)
boat.ages[c(1, 1, 1)]
```


It it makes your code clearer, you can define an indexing object before doing your actual indexing. For example, let's define an object called `my.index` and use this object to index our data vector:

```{r}
my.index <- 3:5
boat.names[my.index]
```


## Logical Indexing

```{r, fig.cap= "Logical indexing. Good for R aliens and R pirates.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/logic.jpg"))
```


The second way to index vectors is with *logical vectors*. A logical vector is a vector that *only* contains TRUE and FALSE values. In R, true values are designated with TRUE, and false values with FALSE. When you index a vector with a logical vector, R will return values of the vector for which the indexing vector is TRUE. If that was confusing, think about it this way: a logical vector, combined with the brackets `[ ]`, acts as a *filter* for the vector it is indexing. It only lets values of the vector pass through for which the logical vector is TRUE.

```{r, fig.cap= "FALSE values in a logical vector are like lots of mini-Gandolfs. In this example, I am indexing a vector \texttt{x} with a logical vector y (y for example could be x > 0, so all positive values of x are TRUE and all negative values are FALSE). The result is a vector of length 2, which are the values of x for which the logical vector y was true. Gandolf stopped all the values of x for which y was FALSE.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/indexgandolf.png"))
```


You could create logical vectors directly using `c()`. For example, I could access every other value of the following vector as follows:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

As you can see, R returns all values of the vector `a` for which the logical vector is TRUE.

```{r fig.cap = "Logical comparison operators in R", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = rep(.1, 4))
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 1.1), ylim = c(0, 10),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     type = "n")


text(rep(0, 9), 9:1,
     labels = c("==", "!=", "<", "<=",
                ">", ">=", "|", "!", "%in%"),
     adj = 0, cex = 2)

text(rep(.2, 9), 9:1,
     labels = c("equal", "not equal", "less than",
                "less than or equal","greater than",
                "greater than or equal", "or", "not", "in the set"),
        adj = 0, cex = 2)
```


However, creating logical vectors using `c()` is tedious. Instead, it's better to create logical vectors from *existing vectors* using comparison operators like < (less than), == (equals to), and != (not equal to). A complete list of the most common comparison operators is in  Figure~\ref{fig:comparison}. For example, let's create some logical vectors from our `boat.ages` vector:

```{r}
# Which ages are > 100?
boat.ages > 100

# Which ages are equal to 23?
boat.ages == 23

# Which boat names are equal to c?
boat.names == "c"
```


You can also create logical vectors by comparing a vector to another vector of the same length. When you do this, R will compare values in the same position (e.g.; the first values will be compared, then the second values, etc.). For example, we can compare the `boat.cost` and `boat.price` vectors to see which boats sold for a higher price than their cost:

```{r}
# Which boats had a higher price than cost?
boat.prices > boat.costs

# Which boats had a lower price than cost?
boat.prices < boat.costs
```

Once you've created a logical vector using a comparison operator, you can use it to index any vector with the same length. Here, I'll use logical vectors to get the prices of boats whose ages were greater than 100:

```{r}
# What were the prices of boats older than 100?
boat.prices[boat.ages > 100]
```


Here's how logical indexing works step-by-step:

```{r}
# Which boat prices are greater than 100?
boat.ages > 100

# Writing the logical index by hand (you'd never do this!)
boat.prices[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]

# Doing it all in one step! You get the same answer
boat.prices[boat.ages > 100]
```



### `&` (and), `|` (or), `%in%`

In addition to using single comparison operators, you can combine multiple logical vectors using the OR (which looks like `|` and AND `\&` commands. The OR `|` operation will return TRUE if any of the logical vectors is TRUE, while the AND `&` operation will only return TRUE if all of the values in the logical vectors is TRUE. This is especially powerful when you want to create a logical vector based on criteria from multiple vectors.

For example, let's create a logical vector indicating which boats had a price greater than 200 OR less than 100, and then use that vector to see what the names of these boats were:

```{r}
# Which boats had prices greater than 400 OR less than 100?
boat.prices > 200 | boat.prices < 100

# What were the NAMES of these boats
boat.names[boat.prices > 200 | boat.prices < 100]
```

You can combine as many logical vectors as you want (as long as they all have the same length!):

```{r}
# Boat names of boats with a color of black OR with a price > 100
boat.names[boat.colors == "black" | boat.prices > 100]

# Names of blue boats with a price greater than 200
boat.names[boat.colors == "blue" & boat.prices > 200]
```


You can combine as many logical vectors as you want to create increasingly complex selection criteria. For example, the following logical vector returns TRUE for cases where the boat colors are black OR brown, AND where the price was not equal to 100:

```{r}
# Which boats were eithe black or brown, AND had a price less than 100?
(boat.colors == "black" | boat.colors == "brown") & boat.prices < 100

# What were the names of these boats?
boat.names[(boat.colors == "black" | boat.colors == "brown") & boat.prices < 100]
```

When using multiple criteria, make sure to use parentheses when appropriate. If I didn't use parentheses above, I would get a different answer.

The `%in%` operation helps you to easily create multiple OR arguments.Imagine you have a vector of categorical data that can take on many different values. For example, you could have a vector x indicating people's favorite letters.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "t", "a", "b", "z")
```


Now, let's say you want to create a logical vector indicating which values are either a or b or c or d. You could create this logical vector with multiple | (OR) commands:

```{r}
x == "a" | x == "b" | x == "c" | x == "d"
```


However, this takes a long time to write. Thankfully, the `%in%` operation allows you to combine multiple OR comparisons much faster. To use the `%in%` function, just put it in between the original vector, and a new vector of possible values. The `%in%` function goes through every value in the vector x, and returns TRUE if it finds it in the vector of possible values -- otherwise it returns FALSE.

```{r}
x %in% c("a", "b", "c", "d")
```


As you can see, the result is identical to our previous result.


### Counts and percentages from logical vectors

Many (if not all) R functions will interpret TRUE values as 1 and FALSE values as 0. This allows us to easily answer questions like "How many values in a data vector are greater than 0?" or "What percentage of values are equal to 5?" by applying the `sum()` or `mean()` function to a logical vector.

We'll start with a vector x of length 10, containing 3 positive numbers and 5 negative numbers.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5)
```


We can create a logical vector to see which values are greater than 0:

```{r}
x > 0
```


Now, we'll use `sum()` and `mean()` on that logical vector to see how many of the values in x are positive, and what percent are positive. We should find that there are 5 TRUE values, and that 50\% of the values (5 / 10) are TRUE.

```{r}
sum(x > 0)
mean(x > 0)
```


This is a *really* powerful tool. Pretty much *any* time you want to answer a question like "How many of X are Y" or "What percent of X are Y", you use `sum()` or `mean()` function with a logical vector as an argument.

### Additional Logical functions

R has lots of special functions that take vectors as arguments, and return logical vectors based on multiple criteria. For example, you can use the `is.na()` function to test which values of a vector are missing. Table \@ref(tab:logicalfunctions) contains some that I frequently use:


| Function| Description|Example | Result
|:--------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|----|
|     `is.na(x)`| Which values in x are NA?|`is.na(c(2, NA, 5))`    | `r is.na(c(2, NA, 5))`|
|     `is.finite(x)`|    Which values in x are numbers?    | `is.finite(c(NA, 89, 0))` | `r is.finite(c(NA, 89, 0))`|
|     `duplicated(x)`|    Which values in x are duplicated? | `duplicated(c(1, 4, 1, 2))` | `r duplicated(c(1, 4, 1, 2))`|
|     `which(x)`|    Which values in x are TRUE? | `which(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))` | `r which(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))`|

Table: (\#tab:logicalfunctions) Functions to create and use logical vectors.

Logical vectors aren't just good for indexing, you can also use them to figure out which values in a vector satisfy some criteria. To do this, use the function `which()`. If you apply the function `which()` to a logical vector, R will tell you which values of the index are TRUE. For example:

```{r}
# A vector of sex information
sex <- c("m", "m", "f", "m", "f", "f")

# Which values of sex are m?
which(sex == "m")

# Which values of sex are f?
which(sex == "f")
```



## Changing values of a vector

Now that you know how to index a vector, you can easily change specific values in a vector using the assignment (`<-`) operation. To do this, just assign a vector of new values to the indexed values of the original vector:

Let's create a vector `a` which contains 10 1s:

```{r}
a <- rep(1, 10)

```


Now, let's change the first 5 values in the vector to 9s by indexing the first five values, and assigning the value of 9:

```{r}
a[1:5] <- 9
a
```



Now let's change the last 5 values to 0s. We'll index the values 6 through 10, and assign a value of 0.

```{r}
a[6:10] <- 0
a
```


Of course, you can also change values of a vector using a logical indexing vector. For example, let's say you have a vector of numbers that should be from 1 to 10. If values are outside of this range, you want to set them to either the minimum (1) or maximum (10) value:

```{r}
# x is a vector of numbers that should be from 1 to 10
x <- c(5, -5, 7, 4, 11, 5, -2)

# Assign values less than 1 to 1
x[x < 1] <- 1

# Assign values greater than 10 to 10
x[x > 10] <- 10

# Print the result!
x
```

As you can see, our new values of x are now never less than 1 or greater than 10!


**A note on indexing...**

Technically, when you assign new values to a vector, you should always assign a vector of the same length as the number of values that you are updating. For example, given a vector a with 10 1s:

```{r}
a <- rep(1, 10)
```

To update the first 5 values with 5 9s, we should assign a new vector of 5 9s

```{r}
a[1:5] <- c(9, 9, 9, 9, 9)
a
```

However, if we repeat this code but just assign a single 9, R will repeat the value as many times as necessary to fill the indexed value of the vector. That's why the following code still works:

```{r}
a[1:5] <- 9
a
```

In other languages this code wouldn't work because we're trying to replace 5 values with just 1. However, this is a case where R bends the rules a bit.



### Ex: Fixing invalid responses to a Happiness survey


```{r, fig.cap= "", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/happiness.png"))
```

Assigning and indexing is a particularly helpful tool when, for example, you want to remove invalid values in a vector before performing an analysis. For example, let's say you asked 10 people how happy they were on a scale of 1 to 5 and received the following responses:

```{r}
happy <- c(1, 4, 2, 999, 2, 3, -2, 3, 2, 999)
```


As you can see, we have some invalid values (999 and -2) in this vector. To remove them, we'll use logical indexing to change the invalid values (999 and -2) to NA. We'll create a logical vector indicating which values of `happy` are *invalid* using the `%in%` operation. Because we want to see which values are *invalid*, we'll add the `== FALSE` condition (If we don't, the index will tell us which values *are* valid).

```{r}
# Which values of happy are NOT in the set 1:5?
invalid <- (happy %in% 1:5) == FALSE
invalid
```

Now that we have a logical index `invalid` telling us which values are invalid (that is, not in the set 1 through 5), we'll index `happy` with `invalid`, and assign the invalid values as NA:

```{r}
# Convert any invalid values in happy to NA
happy[invalid] <- NA
happy
```

We can also recode all the invalid values of \textt{happy} in one line as follows:

```{r}
# Convert all values of happy that are NOT integers from 1 to 5 to NA
happy[(happy %in% 1:5) == FALSE] <- NA
```


As you can see, `happy` now has NAs for previously invalid values. Now we can take a `mean()` of the vector and see the mean of the valid responses.

```{r}
# Include na.rm = TRUE to ignore NA values
mean(happy, na.rm = TRUE)
```




## Test your R Might!: Movie data


```{r, fig.cap= "", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/moviecollage.png"))
```

Table \@ref(tab:moviedata) contains data about 10 of my favorite movies.


```{r moviedata, echo = FALSE}
movie.data <- data.frame("movie" = c("Whatever Works", "It Follows", "Love and Mercy", 
             "The Goonies", "Jiro Dreams of Sushi",
             "There Will be Blood", "Moon", 
             "Spice World", "Serenity", "Finding Vivian Maier"),
             year = c(2009, 2015, 2015, 1985, 2012, 2007, 2009, 1988, 2005, 2014),
             boxoffice = c(35, 15, 15, 62, 3, 10, 321, 79, 39, 1.5),
             genre = c("Comedy", "Horror", "Drama", "Adventure", "Documentary", 
           "Drama", "Science Fiction", "Comedy", "Science Fiction", 
           "Documentary"),
           time = c(92, 97, 120, 90, 81, 158, 97, -84, 119, 84),
           rating = c("PG-13", "R", "R", "PG", "G", "R", "R", 
            "PG-13", "PG-13", "Unrated"))


knitr::kable(movie.data, caption = "Some of my favorite movies")
```

0. Create new data vectors for each column.

1. What is the name of the 10th movie in the list?

2. What are the genres of the first 4 movies?

3. Some joker put Spice World in the movie names -- it should be ``The Naked Gun'' Please correct the name.

4. What were the names of the movies made before 1990?

5. How many movies were Dramas? What percent of the 10 movies were Dramas?

6. One of the values in the `time` vector is invalid. Convert any invalid values in this vector to NA. Then, calculate the mean movie time

7. What were the names of the Comedy movies? What were their boxoffice totals? (Two separate questions)

8. What were the names of the movies that made less than \$50 Million dollars AND were Comedies?

9. What was the median boxoffice revenue of movies rated either G or PG?

10. What percent of the movies were rated R OR were comedies?

# Matrices and Dataframes {#matricesdataframes}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r, fig.cap= "Did you actually think I could talk about matrices without a Matrix reference?!", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/matrix.jpg"))
```


## What are matrices and dataframes?

By now, you should be comfortable with scalar and vector objects. However, you may have noticed that neither object types are appropriate for storing lots of data -- such as the results of a survey or experiment. Thankfully, R has two object types that represent large data structures much better: **matrices** and **dataframes*}**.

Matrices and dataframes are very similar to spreadsheets in Excel or data files in SPSS. Every matrix or dataframe contains rows (call that number m) and columns (n). Thus, wile a vector has 1 dimension (its length), matrices and dataframes both have 2-dimensions -- representing their width and height. You can think of a matrix or dataframe as a combination of `n` vectors, where each vector has a length of `m`. See Figure \@ref(fig:scalervectormatrix) to see the shocking difference between these data objects.


```{r scalervectormatrix, fig.cap = "scalar, Vector, Matrix... ::drops mike::", echo = FALSE}
# scalar v vector v matrix

par(mar = rep(1, 4))
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(-.5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     bty = "n", type = "n")

# scalar
rect(rep(0, 1), rep(0, 1), rep(1, 1), rep(1, 1))
text(.5, -.5, "scalar")

# Vector
rect(rep(2, 5), 0:4, rep(3, 5), 1:5)
text(2.5, -.5, "Vector")

# Matrix
rect(rep(4:8, each = 5),
     rep(0:4, times = 5),
     rep(5:9, each = 5),
     rep(1:5, times = 5))
text(6.5, -.5, "Matrix / Data Frame"
     )
```

While matrices and dataframes look very similar, they aren't exactly the same. While a matrix can contain *either* character *or* numeric columns, a dataframe can contain *both* numeric and character columns. Because dataframes are more flexible, most real-world datasets, such as surveys containing both numeric (e.g.; age, response times) and character (e.g.; sex, favorite movie) data, will be stored as dataframes in R.

**WTF** -- If dataframes are more flexible than matrices, why do we use matrices at all? The answer is that, because they are simpler, matrices take up less computational space than dataframes. Additionally, some functions require matrices as inputs to ensure that they work correctly.

In the next section, we'll cover the most common functions for creating matrix and dataframe objects. We'll then move on to functions that take matrices and dataframes as inputs.



## Creating matrices and dataframes

There are a number of ways to create your own matrix and dataframe objects in R. The most common functions are presented in Table \@ref(tab:matrixfunctions). Because matrices and dataframes are just combinations of vectors, each function takes one or more vectors as inputs, and returns a matrix or a dataframe.


| Function| Description| Example |
|:-------------|:-------------------|:------------------------------|
|     `cbind(a, b, c)`| Combine vectors as columns in a matrix |`cbind(1:5, 6:10, 11:15)`     |
|     `rbind(a, b, c)`| Combine vectors as rows in a matrix|`rbind(1:5, 6:10, 11:15)`    |
|     `matrix(x, nrow, ncol, byrow)`| Create a matrix from a vector `x`   | `matrix(x = 1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)` |
|     `data.frame()`|  Create a dataframe from named columns | `data.frame("age" = c(19, 21),` <br>`sex = c("m", "f"))` |

Table: (\#tab:matrixfunctions) Functions to create matrices and dataframes.

### `cbind()`, `rbind()`

`cbind()` and `rbind()` both create matrices by combining several vectors of the same length. `cbind()` combines vectors as columns, while `rbind()` combines them as rows.

Let's use these functions to create a matrix with the numbers 1 through 30. First, we'll create three vectors of length 10, then we'll combine them into one matrix. As you will see, the `cbind()` function will combine the vectors as columns in the final matrix, while the `rbind()` function will combine them as rows.


```{r}
x <- 1:5
y <- 6:10
z <- 11:15

# Create a matrix where x, y and z are columns
cbind(x, y, z)

# Create a matrix where x, y and z are rows
rbind(x, y, z)
```


### `matrix()`

**Remember**: Matrices can either contain numbers *or* character vectors, not both!. If you try to create a matrix with both numbers and characters, it will turn all the numbers into characters:

```{r}
# Creating a matrix with numeric and character columns will make everything a character:

cbind(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
      c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
```


The `matrix()` function creates a matrix form a single vector of data. The function has 3 main inputs: `data` -- a vector of data, `nrow` -- the number of rows you want in the matrix, and `ncol` -- the number of columns you want in the matrix, and `byrow` -- a logical value indicating whether you want to fill the matrix by rows. Check out the help menu for the matrix function (`?matrix) to see some additional inputs.

Let's use the `matrix()` function to re-create a matrix containing the values from 1 to 10.

```{r}
# Create a matrix of the integers 1:10,
#  with 5 rows and 2 columns

matrix(data = 1:10,
       nrow = 5,
       ncol = 2)

# Now with 2 rows and 5 columns
matrix(data = 1:10,
       nrow = 2,
       ncol = 5)

# Now with 2 rows and 5 columns, but fill by row instead of columns
matrix(data = 1:10,
       nrow = 2,
       ncol = 5,
       byrow = TRUE)
```


### `data.frame()`

To create a dataframe from vectors, use the `data.frame()` function. The `data.frame()` function works very similarly to `cbind()` -- the only difference is that in `data.frame()` you specify names to each of the columns as you define them. Again, unlike matrices, dataframes can contain *both* string vectors and numeric vectors within the same object. Because they are more flexible than matrices, most large datasets in R will be stored as dataframes.

Let's create a simple dataframe called `survey` using the `data.frame()` function with a mixture of text and numeric columns:

```{r}
# Create a dataframe of survey data

survey <- data.frame("index" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "sex" = c("m", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
                     "age" = c(99, 46, 23, 54, 23))
survey
```


#### `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`

Thre is one key argument to `data.frame()` and similar functions called `stringsAsFactors`. By default, the `data.frame()` function will automctailly convert any string columns to a specific type of object called a **factor** in R. A factor is nominal variable that has a well-specified possible set of values that it can take on. For example, one can create a factor `sex` that can *only* take on the values `"male"` and `"female"`.

However, as I'm sure you're discover, having R automatically convert your string data to factors can lead to lots of strange results. For example: if you have a factor of sex data, but then you want to add a new value called `other`, R will yell at you and return an error. I *hate*, *hate*, *HATE* when this happens. While there are very, very rare cases when I find factors use ful, I almost always don't want or need them. For this reason, I avoid them at all costs.

To tell R to *not* convert your string columns to factors, you need to include the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when using functions such as `data.frame()`

For example, let's look at the clases of the columns in the dataframe `survey` that we just created using the `str()` function (we'll go over this function in section XXX)

```{r}
# Show me the structure of the survey dataframe
str(survey)
```

AAAAA!!! R has converted the column `sex` to a factor with *only* two possible levels! This can cause major problems later! Let's create the dataframe again using the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to make sure that this doesn't happen:

```{r}
# Create a dataframe of survey data WITHOUT factors
survey <- data.frame("index" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "sex" = c("m", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
                     "age" = c(99, 46, 23, 54, 23),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Now let's look at the new version and make sure there are no factors:

```{r}
# Print the result (it looks the same as before)
survey

# Look at the structure: no more factors!
str(survey)
```


### Dataframes pre-loaded in R

Now you know how to use functions like `cbind()` and `data.frame()` to manually create your own matrices and dataframes in R. However, for demonstration purposes, it's frequently easier to use existing dataframes rather than always having to create your own. Thankfully, R has us covered: R has several datasets that come pre-installed in a package called `datasets` -- you don't need to install this package, it's included in the base R software. While you probably won't make any major scientific discoveries with these datasets, they allow all R users to test and compare code on the same sets of data. To see a complete list of all the datasets included in the `datasets` package, run the code: `library(help = "datasets")`. Table \@ref(tab:datasets) shows a few datasets that we will be using in future examples:


| Dataset| Description| Rows | Columns | 
|:-----------|:-----------------------------|:----|:-----|
|     `ChickWeight`|  Experiment on the effect of diet on early growth of chicks. | 578 | 4 |
|     `InsectSprays`| The counts of insects in agricultural experimental units treated with different insecticides. | 72 | 2 |
|     `ToothGrowth`| Length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs.  | 60 | 3 |
|     `PlantGrowth`|Results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions. | 30 | 2 |

Table: (\#tab:datasets) A few datasets you can access in R.

## Matrix and dataframe functions

R has lots of functions for viewing matrices and dataframes and returning information about them. Table \@ref(tab:dataframefunctions) shows some of the most common:

| Function| Description| 
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|     `head(x), tail(x)`| Print the first few rows (or last few rows). | 
|     `View(x)`| Open the entire object in a new window | 
|     `nrow(x), ncol(x), dim(x)`| Count the number of rows and columns  | 
|     `rownames(), colnames(), names()`| Show the row (or column) names   | 
|     `str(x), summary(x)`| Show the structure of the dataframe (ie., dimensions and classes) and summary statistics| 

Table: (\#tab:dataframefunctions) Important functions for understanding matrices and dataframes.

### `head(), tail(), View()`

To see the first few rows of a dataframe, use `head()`, to see the last few rows, use `tail()`

```{r}
# head() shows the first few rows
head(ChickWeight)

# tail() shows he last few rows
tail(ChickWeight)
```


To see an entire dataframe in a separate window that looks like spreadsheet, use `View()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# View() opens the entire dataframe in a new window
View(ChickWeight)
```

When you run `View()`, you'll see a new window like the one in Figure \@ref(fig:viewchicks)


```{r viewchicks, fig.cap= "Screenshot of the window from View(ChickWeight). You can use this window to visually sort and filter the data to get an idea of how it looks, but you can't add or remove data and nothing you do will actually change the dataframe.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/chickweightscreenshot.png"))
```

### `summary()`, `str()`

To get summary statistics on all columns in a dataframe, use the `summary()` function:

```{r}
# Print summary statistics of ToothGrowth to the console
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

To learn about the classes of columns in a dataframe, in addition to some other summary information, use the `str()` (structure) function. This function returns information for more advanced R users, so don't worry if the output looks confusing.

```{r}
# Print additional information about ToothGrowth to the console
str(ToothGrowth)
```

Here, we can see that `ToothGrowth` is a dataframe with 60 observations (ie., rows) and 3 variables (ie., columns). We can also see that the column names are `len`, `supp`, and `dose`



## Dataframe column names

One of the nice things about dataframes is that each column will have a name. You can use these name to access specific columns by name without having to know which column number it is.


To access the names of a dataframe, use the function `names()`. This will return a string vector with the names of the dataframe. Let's use `names()` to get the names of the `ToothGrowth` dataframe:

```{r}
# What are the names of columns in the ToothGrowth dataframe?
names(ToothGrowth)
```


To access a specific column in a dataframe by name, you use the `$` operator in the form `df$name` where `df` is the name of the dataframe, and `name` is the name of the column you are interested in. This operation will then return the column you want as a vector.


Let's use the `$` operator to get a vector of just the length column (called `len`) from the `ToothGrowth` dataframe:

```{r}
# Return the len column of ToothGrowth
ToothGrowth$len
```

Because the `$` operator returns a vector, you can easily calculate descriptive statistics on columns of a dataframe by applying your favorite vector function (like `mean()` or `table()`) to a column using `$`. Let's calculate the mean tooth length with `mean()`, and the frequency of each supplement with `table()`:

```{r}
# What is the mean of the len column of ToothGrowth?
mean(ToothGrowth$len)

# Give me a table of the supp column of ToothGrowth.
table(ToothGrowth$supp)
```


If you want to access several columns by name, you can forgo the \$ operator, and put a character vector of column names in brackets: 
```{r}
# Give me the len AND supp columns of ToothGrowth
head(ToothGrowth[c("len", "supp")])
```


### Adding new columns

You can add new columns to a dataframe using the `$` and assignment `<-` operators. To do this, just use the `df$name` notation and assign a new vector of data to it. 

For example, let's create a dataframe called `survey` with two columns: `index` and `age`:
```{r}
# Create a new dataframe called survey
survey <- data.frame("index" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "age" = c(24, 25, 42, 56, 22))

survey
```

Now, let's add a new column called `sex` with a vector of sex data:

```{r}
# Add a new column called sex to survey
survey$sex <- c("m", "m", "f", "f", "m")
```

Here's the result

```{r}
# survey with new sex column
survey
```

As you can see, `survey` has a new column with the name `sex` with the values we specified earlier. 

### Changing column names

To change the name of a column in a dataframe, just use a combination of the `names()` function, indexing, and reassignment. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Change name of 1st column of df to "a"
names(df)[1] <- "a"

# Change name of 2nd column of df to "b"
names(df)[2] <- "b"
```

For example, let's change the name of the first column of `survey` from `index` to `participant.number`

```{r}
# Change the name of the first column of survey to "participant.number"
names(survey)[1] <- "participant.number"
survey
```

**Warning!!!**: Change column names with logical indexing to avoid errors!

Now, there is one major potential problem with my method above -- I had to manually enter the value of 1. But what if the column I want to change isn't in the first column (either because I typed it wrong or because the order of the columns changed)? This could lead to serious problems later on.

To avoid these issues, it's better to change column names using a logical vector using the format `names(df)[names(df) == "old.name"] <- "new.name"`. Here's how to read this: "Change the names of `df`, but only where the original name was `"old.name"`, to `"new.name"`.

Let's use logical indexing to change the name of the column `survey$age` to `survey$years`:

```{r}
# Change the column name from age to age.years
names(survey)[names(survey) == "age"] <- "years"
survey
```



## Slicing dataframes

Once you have a dataset stored as a matrix or dataframe in R, you'll want to start accessing specific parts of the data based on some criteria. For example, if your dataset contains the result of an experiment comparing different experimental groups, you'll want to calculate statistics for each experimental group separately. The process of selecting specific rows and columns of data based on some criteria is commonly known as *slicing*. 


```{r, fig.cap= "Slicing and dicing data. The turnip represents your data, and the knife represents indexing with brackets, or subsetting functions like subset(). The red-eyed clown holding the knife is just off camera.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "250px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/turnip.jpg"))
```



### Slicing with `[, ]`

Just like vectors, you can access specific data in dataframes using brackets. But now, instead of just using one indexing vector, we use two indexing vectors: one for the rows and one for the columns. To do this, use the notation `data[rows, columns]`, where `rows` and `columns` are vectors of integers.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Return row 1
df[1, ]

# Return column 5
df[, 5]

# Rows 1:5 and column 2
df[1:5, 2]
```




```{r, fig.cap= "Ah the ToothGrowth dataframe. Yes, one of the dataframes stored in R contains data from an experiment testing the effectiveness of different doses of Vitamin C supplements on the growth of guinea pig teeth. The images I found by Googling ``guinea pig teeth'' were all pretty horrifying, so let's just go with this one.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/guineapig.jpg"))
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(ToothGrowth), caption = "First few rows of the ToothGrowth dataframe.")
```



Let's try indexing the `ToothGrowth` dataframe. Again, the `ToothGrowth` dataframe represents the results of a study testing the effectiveness of different types of supplements on the length of guinea pig's teeth. First, let's look at the entries in rows 1 through 5, and column 1:


```{r}
# Give me the rows 1-6 and column 1 of ToothGrowth
ToothGrowth[1:6, 1]
```


Because the first column is `len`, the primary dependent measure, this means that the tooth lengths in the first 5 observations are `r ToothGrowth[1:6, 1]`.

Of course, you can index matrices and dataframes with longer vectors to get more data. Now, let's look at the first 3 rows of columns 1 and 3:

```{r}
# Give me rows 1-3 and columns 1 and 3 of ToothGrowth
ToothGrowth[1:3, c(1,3)]
```

If you want to look at an entire row or an entire column of a matrix or dataframe, you can leave the corresponding index blank. For example, to see the entire 1st row of the `ToothGrowth` dataframe, we can set the row index to 1, and leave the column index blank:

```{r}
# Give me the 1st row (and all columns) of ToothGrowth
ToothGrowth[1, ]
```

Similarly, to get the entire 2nd column, set the column index to 2 and leave the row index blank:

```{r}
# Give me the 2nd column (and all rows) of ToothGrowth
ToothGrowth[, 2]
```


Many, if not all, of the analyses you will be doing will be on subsets of data, rather than entire datasets. For example, if you have data from an experiment, you may wish to calculate the mean of participants in one group separately from another. To do this, we'll use *subsetting* -- selecting subsets of data based on some criteria. To do this, we can use one of two methods: indexing with logical vectors, or the `subset()` function. We'll start with logical indexing first.


### Slicing with logical vectors

Indexing dataframes with logical vectors is almost identical to indexing single vectors. First, we create a logical vector containing only TRUE and FALSE values. Next, we index a dataframe (typically the rows) using the logical vector to return *only* values for which the logical vector is TRUE.

For example, to create a new dataframe called `ToothGrowth.VC` containing only data from the guinea pigs who were given the VC supplement, we'd run the following code:

```{r}
# Create a new df with only the rows of ToothGrowth
#  where supp equals VC
ToothGrowth.VC <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC", ]
```

Of course, just like we did with vectors, we can make logical vectors based on multiple criteria -- and then index a dataframe based on those criteria. For example, let's create a dataframe called `ToothGrowth.OJ.a` that contains data from the guinea pigs who were given an OJ supplement with a dose less than 1.0:

```{r}
# Create a new df with only the rows of ToothGrowth
#  where supp equals OJ and dose < 1

ToothGrowth.VC.a <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ" &
                                ToothGrowth$dose < 1, ]
```


Indexing with brackets is the standard way to slice and dice dataframes. However, the code can get a bit messy. A more elegant method is to use the `subset()` function.

### Slicing with `subset()`

```{r, fig.cap= "The subset() function is like a lightsaber. An elegant function from a more civilized age.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/saber.jpeg"))
```

The `subset()` function is one of the most useful data management functions in R. It allows you to slice and dice datasets just like you would with brackets, but the code is much easier to write: Table \@ref(tab:subsetfunction) shows the main arguments to the `subset()` function:

| Argument| Description| 
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|     `x`| A dataframe you want to subset| 
|     `subset`| A logical vector indicating the rows to keep | 
|     `select`| The columns you want to keep | 

Table: (\#tab:subsetfunction) Main arguments for the `subset()` function.


Let's use the `subset()` function to create a new, subsetted dataset from the `ToothGrowth` dataframe containing data from guinea pigs who had a tooth length less than 20cm (`len < 20`), given the OJ supplement (`supp == "OJ"`), and with a dose greater than or equal to 1 (`dose >= 1`):

```{r}
# Get rows of ToothGrowth where len < 20 AND supp == "OJ" AND dose >= 1

subset(x = ToothGrowth,
      subset = len < 20 &
               supp == "OJ" &
               dose >= 1)
```

As you can see, there were only two cases that satisfied all 3 of our selection criteria.

In the example above, I didn't specify an input to the `select` argument because I wanted all columns. However, if you just want certain columns, you can just name the columns you want in the `select` argument:

```{r}
# Get rows of ToothGrowth where len > 30 AND supp == "VC", but only return the len and index columns

subset(x = ToothGrowth,
      subset = len > 30 &
               supp == "VC",
      select = c(len, index))
```


## Combining slicing with functions

Now that you know how to slice and dice dataframes using indexing and `subset()`, you can easily combine slicing and dicing with statistical functions to calculate summary statistics on groups of data. For example, the following code will calculate the mean tooth length of guinea pigs with the OJ supplement using the `subset()` function:

```{r}
# What is the mean tooth length of Guinea pigs given OJ?

# Step 1: Create a subsettted dataframe called oj

oj <- subset(x = ToothGrowth,
             subset = supp == "OJ")

# Step 2: Calculate the mean of the len column from
#  the new subsetted dataset

mean(oj$len)
```

We can also get the same solution using logical indexing:

```{r}
# Step 1: Create a subsettted dataframe called oj
oj <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ",]

# Step 2: Calculate the mean of the len column from
#  the new subsetted dataset
mean(oj$len)
```

Or heck, we can do it all in one line by only referring to column vectors:

```{r}
mean(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"])
```

As you can see, R allows for many methods to accomplish the same task. The choice is up to you.

### `with()`

The `with()` function helps to save you some typing when you are using multiple columns from a dataframe. Specifically, it allows you to specify a dataframe (or any other object in R) once at the beginning of a line -- then, for every object you refer to in the code in that line, R will assume you're referring to that object in an expression.

For example, let's create a dataframe called `health` with some health information:

```{r}
health <- data.frame("age" = c(32, 24, 43, 19, 43),
                     "height" = c(1.75, 1.65, 1.50, 1.92, 1.80),
                     "weight" = c(70, 65, 62, 79, 85))

health
```

Now let's say we want to add a new column called `bmi` which represents a person's body mass index. The formula for bmi is $bmi = \frac{height}{weight^{2}} \times 703$. If we wanted to calculate the bmi of each person, we'd need to write `health$height / health$weight ^ 2`:

```{r}
# Calculate bmi
health$weight / health$height ^ 2
```

As you can see, we have to retype the name of the dataframe for each column. However, using the `with()` function, we can make it a bit easier by saying the name of the dataframe once.

```{r}
# Save typing by using with()
with(health, weight / height ^ 2)
```

As you can see, the results are identical. In this case, we didn't save so much typing. But if you are doing many calculations, then `with()` can save you a lot of typing. For example, contrast these two lines of code that perform identical calculations:

```{r}
# Long code
health$weight + health$height / health$age + 2 * health$height

# Short code that does the same thing
with(health, weight + height / age + 2 * height)
```

```{r, fig.cap= "This is a lesser-known superhero named Maggott who could 'transform his body to get superhuman strength and endurance, but to do so he needed to release two huge parasitic worms from his stomach cavity and have them eat things' (http://heavy.com/comedy/2010/04/the-20-worst-superheroes/). Yeah...I'm shocked this guy wasn't a hit.", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/maggot.jpg"))
```



The following table shows the results of a survey of 10 pirates. In addition to some basic demographic information, the survey asked each pirate "What is your favorite superhero?"" and "How many tattoos do you have?""

```{r echo = FALSE}

  Superhero = c("Batman", "Superman", "Batman", "Spiderman", "Batman",
               "Antman", "Batman", "Superman", "Maggott", "Superman"),
  Tattoos = c(11, 15, 12, 5, 65, 3, 9, 13, 900, 0)
)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
thisone <- 1
THISONE <- 2
this.one <- 3

3. 2015 was a good year for pirate booty - your ship collected 100,000 gold coins. Create an object called \texttt{gold.in.2015} and assign the correct value to it.

```{r}
gold.in.2015 <- 100800
```


4. Oops, during the last inspection we discovered that one of your pirates Skippy McGee hid 800 gold coins in his underwear. Go ahead and add those gold coins to the object `gold.in.2015`. Next, create an object called `plank.list` with the name of the pirate thief.

```{r}
gold.in.2015 <- gold.in.2015 + 800
plank.list <- "Skippy McGee"
```

5. Look at the code below. What will R return after the third line? Make a prediction, then test the code yourself.

```

## Chapter 5: Scalers and vectors

1. Create the vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] in three ways: once using `c()`, once using `a:b`, and once using `seq()`.

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

1:10

seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```


2. Create the vector [2.1, 4.1, 6.1, 8.1] in two ways, once using `c()` and once using `seq()`

```{r}

c(2.1, 6.1, 6.1, 8.1)

seq(from = 2.1, to = 8.1, by = 2)

```


3. Create the vector [0, 5, 10, 15] in 3 ways: using `c()`, `seq()` with a `by` argument, and `seq()` with a `length.out` argument.

```{r}
c(0, 5, 10, 15)

seq(from = 0, to = 15, by = 5)

seq(from = 0, to = 15, length.out = 4)
```

4. Create the vector [101, 102, 103, 200, 205, 210, 1000, 1100, 1200] using a combination of the `c()` and `seq()` functions

```{r}
c(seq(from = 101, to = 103, by = 3), 
  seq(from = 200, to = 210, by = 5), 
  seq(from = 1000, to = 1200, by = 100))
```

5. A new batch of 100 pirates are boarding your ship and need new swords. You have 10 scimitars, 40 broadswords, and 50 cutlasses that you need to distribute evenly to the 100 pirates as they board. Create a vector of length 100 where there is 1 scimitar, 4 broadswords, and 5 cutlasses in each group of 10. That is, in the first 10 elements there should be exactly 1 scimitar, 4 broadswords and 5 cutlasses. The next 10 elements should also have the same number of each sword (and so on).

```{r}
swords <- rep(c("scimitar", rep("broadswoard", 4), rep("cutlass", 5)), times = 100)
head(swords)
```


6. Create a vector that repeats the integers from 1 to 5, 10 times. That is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]. The length of the vector should be 50!

```{r}
rep(1:5, times = 10)
```


7. Now, create the same vector as before, but this time repeat 1, 10 times, then 2, 10 times, etc., That is [1, 1, 1, ..., 2, 2, 2, ..., ... 5, 5, 5]. The length of the vector should also be 50

```{r}
rep(1:5, each = 10)
```


8. Create a vector containing 50 samples from a Normal distribution with a population mean of 20 and standard deviation of 2.

```{r}
rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 2)
```

9. Create a vector containing 25 samples from a Uniform distribution with a lower bound of -100 and an upper bound of -50.

```{r}
runif(n = 25, min = -100, max = -50)
```


## Chapter 6: Vector Functions


1. Create a vector that shows the square root of the integers from 1 to 10.

```{r}
(1:10) ^ .5

#or

sqrt(1:10)
```


2. Renata thinks that she finds more treasure when she's had a mug of grogg than when she doesn't. To test this, she recorded how much treasure she found over 7 days without drinking any grogg (ie., sober), and then did the same over 7 days while drinking grogg (ie., drunk). Here are her results:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renata.score <- data.frame(
                          day = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"),
                          sober = c(2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 5),
                           drunk = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2))

knitr::kable(renata.score, caption = "Renata's treasure haul when she was sober and when she was drunk")
```

How much treasure did Renata find on average whe she was sober? What about when she was drunk?

```{r}
sober <- c(2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 5)
drunk <- c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2)

mean(sober)
mean(drunk)
```

3. Using Renata's data again, create a new vector called `difference` that shows how much more treasure Renata found when she was drunk and when she was not. What was the mean, median, and standard deviation of the difference?

```{r}
difference <- sober - drunk

mean(difference)
median(difference)
sd(difference)
```


4. There's an old parable that goes something like this. A man does some work for a king and needs to be paid. Because the man loves rice (who doesn't?!), the man offers the king two different ways that he can be paid. *You can either pay me 100 kilograms of rice, or, you can pay me as follows: get a chessboard and put one grain of rice in the top left square. Then put 2 grains of rice on the next square, followed by 4 grains on the next, 8 grains on the next...and so on, where the amount of rice doubles on each square, until you get to the last square. When you are finished, give me all the grains of rice that would (in theory), fit on the chessboard.* The king, sensing that the man was an idiot for making such a stupid offer, immediately accepts the second option. He summons a chessboard, and begins counting out grains of rice one by one... Assuming that there are 64 squares on a chessboard, calculate how many grains of rice the main will receive. If one grain of rice weights 1/64000 kilograms, how many kilograms of rice did he get? *Hint: If you have trouble coming up with the answer, imagine how many grains are on the first, second, third and fourth squares, then try to create the vector that shows the number of grains on each square. Once you come up with that vector, you can easily calculate the final answer with the `sum()` function.*

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# First, let's create a vector of the amount of rice on each square:
rice <- 2 ^ (1:64)

# Here are the first few spaces
head(rice)

# The result is just the sum!
rice.total <- sum(rice)
rice.total

# How much does that weigh? Each grain weights 1/6400 kilograms:
rice.kg <- sum(rice) * 1/6400
rice.kg

# That's 5,800,000,000,000,000 kilograms of rice. Let's keep going....
# A kg of rice is 1,300 calories

rice.cal <- rice.kg * 1300
rice.cal

# How many people can that feed for a year?
# A person needs about 2,250 calories a day, or 2,250 * 365 per year

rice.people.year <- rice.cal / (2250 * 365)
rice.people.year

# So, that amount of rice could feed 9,100,000,000,000 for a year
# Assuming that the averge lifespan is 70 years, how many lifespans could this feed?

rice.people.life <- rice.people.year / 70
rice.people.life

# Ok...so it could feed 130,000,000,000 (130 billion) people over their lives

# Conclusion: King done screwed up.
```

## Chapter 8: Matrices and Dataframes


The following table shows the results of a survey of 10 pirates. In addition to some basic demographic information, the survey asked each pirate "What is your favorite superhero?"" and "How many tattoos do you have?""

```{r echo = FALSE}
superhero <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Astrid", "Lea", "Sarina", "Remon", "Letizia", "Babice", "Jonas", "Wendy", "Niveditha", "Gioia"),
  Sex = c("F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F"),
  Age = c(30, 25, 25, 29, 22, 22, 35, 19, 32, 21),
  Superhero = c("Batman", "Superman", "Batman", "Spiderman", "Batman",
               "Antman", "Batman", "Superman", "Maggott", "Superman"),
  Tattoos = c(11, 15, 12, 5, 65, 3, 9, 13, 900, 0)
)

knitr::kable(superhero)
```


1. Combine the data into a single dataframe. Complete all the following exercises from the dataframe!
  
```{r}
piratesurvey <- data.frame(
  name = c("Astrid", "Lea", "Sarina", "Remon", "Letizia", "Babice", "Jonas", "Wendy", "Niveditha", "Gioia"),
  sex = c("F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F"),
  age = c(30, 25, 25, 29, 22, 22, 35, 19, 32, 21),
  superhero = c("Batman", "Superman", "Batman", "Spiderman", "Batman",
               "Antman", "Batman", "Superman", "Maggott", "Superman"),
  tattoos = c(11, 15, 12, 5, 65, 3, 9, 13, 900, 0),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

2. What is the median age of the 10 pirates?
  
```{r}
median(piratesurvey$age)
```

  
3. What was the mean age of female and male pirates separately?

```{r}
mean(piratesurvey$age[piratesurvey$sex == "F"])
mean(piratesurvey$age[piratesurvey$sex == "M"])

## OR
with(piratesurvey, 
     mean(age[sex == "F"]))

with(piratesurvey, 
     mean(age[sex == "M"]))

## OR

mean(subset(piratesurvey,
       subset = sex == "F")$age)

mean(subset(piratesurvey,
       subset = sex == "M")$age)
```

  
4. What was the most number of tattoos owned by a male pirate?

```{r}
with(piratesurvey, 
     max(tattoos[sex == "M"]))

# OR

max(subset(piratesurvey, 
           subset = sex == "M")$tattoos)
```


5. What percent of pirates under the age of 32 were female?

```{r}
with(piratesurvey, 
     mean(sex[age < 32] == "F"))
```

6. What percent of female pirates are under the age of 32?
  
```{r}
with(piratesurvey, 
     mean(sex[age < 32] == "F"))
```

  
7. Add a new column to the dataframe called `tattoos.per.year` which shows how many tattoos each pirate has for each year in their life.

```{r}
piratesurvey$tattoos.per.year <- with(piratesurvey, tattoos / age)
```

8. Which pirate had the most number of tattoos per year?

```{r}
piratesurvey$name[piratesurvey$tattoos.per.year == max(piratesurvey$tattoos.per.year)]
```

9. What are the names of the female pirates whose favorite piratesurvey is Superman?
  
```{r}
piratesurvey$name[with(piratesurvey, sex == "F" & superhero == "Superman")]
```
  
10. What was the median number of tattoos of pirates over the age of 20 whose favorite piratesurvey is Spiderman?

```{r}
with(piratesurvey, (tattoos[age > 20 & superhero == "Spiderman"]))
```
